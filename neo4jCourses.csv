MODERN POLITICAL THOUGHT,null,42019,/courses/42019,This course will provide an overview of major figures and themes of modern political thought. We will focus on themes and questions pertinent to political theory in the modern era particularly focusing on the relationship of the individual to community society and state. Although the emergence of the individual as a central moral political and conceptual category arguably began in earlier eras it is in the seventeenth century that it takes firm hold in defining the state political institutions moral thinking and social relations. The centrality of the individual has created difficulties even paradoxes for community and social relations and political theorists have struggled to reconicle those throughout the modern era. We will consider the political forms that emerged out of those struggles as well as the changed and distinctly modern conceptualizations of political theory such as freedom responsibilty justice rights and obligations as central categories for organizing moral and political life.,[PSCI-181],3.01,3.29,2.13,-1.0,2.01,-1.0,-1.0,173

COMPARISON COSMOPOLITANISM AND THE GLOBAL NOVEL,null,38453,/courses/38453,Literature does not exist for your protection. So dangerous is it that Socrates argued poets ought to be banned from his ideal Republic. And Socrates himself--one of the most subversive of all poetic thinkers--was condemned to death for corrupting the young with his speeches. All great literature is unsettling and alarming. Along with its beauty and delicacy and rhetorical power and ethical force it can be terrifyingly sublime and even downright ugly: full of contempt and horror and grandiosity and malice. From Socrates' day to our own countless writers have been jailed exiled and murdered their works censored banned burned for daring to say what others wish would remain unsaid--about religion and the State; sexuality gender and the body; art science and commerce; freedom and order; love and hate--and for saying it in ways that are aesthetically innovative surprising seductive ravishingly unanticipated.,[ENGL-100 -- COML-100],3.43,3.71,2.23,-1.0,2.62,-1.0,-1.0,14

During this course we will learn more about these other matters and discover their place in the cultures and civilizations of that area.,[NELC-101 -- HIST-024 -- ANCH-025],2.44,2.76,2.18,-1.0,1.96,-1.0,-1.0,34
LECTURE: Introduction to Management,null,44497,/courses/44497,We all spend much of our lives in organizations. Most of us are born in organizations educated in organizations and work in organizations. Organizations emerge because individuals can't (or don't want to) accomplish their goals alone. Management is the art and science of helping individuals achieve their goals together. Managers in an organization determine where their organization is going and how it gets there. More formally managers formulate strategies and implement those strategies. This course provides a framework for understanding the opportunities and challenges involved in formulating and implementing strategies by taking a system view of organizationswhich means that we examine multiple aspects of how managers address their environments strategy structure culture tasks people and outputs and how managerial decisions made in these various domains interrelate. The course will help you to understand and analyze how managers can formulate and implement strategies effectively. It will be particularly valuable if you are interested in management consulting investment analysis or entrepreneurship - but it will help you to better understand and be a more effective contributor to any organizations you join whether they are large established firms or startups.,[MGMT-101],2.73,3.27,1.96,2.71,1.77,2.23,2.87,114
THE HIDDEN WORLD OF PRIVACY POLICIES,null,41200,/courses/41200,The US Federal Trade Commission considers privacy policies essential for internet sites and apps. Lawyers for firms with internet sites and/or apps spend much time writing privacy policies.

The aim of this course will be to examine this crucial but misunderstood aspect of modern life. You will learn how to read privacy policies how to understand their strategic business purposes within the internet industry and how to think about the implications for society when the key rules of surveillance and privacy are hidden from all but a relative few. You will also work with others in the class to create and carry out a survey of college students' understanding of privacy policies. There will be one exam and a paper related to the survey.,[COMM-330],3.0,3.43,2.67,3.67,2.5,3.0,3.5,7

Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome as well as a few contemporary American ones as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals societies and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear though we do not realize it? Investigate these questions through a variety of topics creation of the universe between gods and mortals religion and family sex love madness and death.,[CLST-100 -- COML-108],2.93,3.32,2.28,-1.0,2.82,-1.0,-1.0,223

The couse takes a broadly chronological approach blending the perspectives of the patientthe physicianand society as a whole--recognizing that medicine has always aspired to treat healthy people as well as the sick and infirm. Rather than history from the top downor from the bottom upthis course sets its sights on history from the inside out. This means first that medical knowledge and practice is understood through the personal experiences of patients and caregivers. It also means that lectures and discussions will take the long-discredited knowledge and treatments of the past seriouslyon their own terms rather than judging them by todays's standards. Required readings consist largely of primary sources from elite medical texts to patient diaries. Short research assignments will encourge students to adopt the perspectives of a range of actors in various historical eras.,[HSOC-002 -- STSC-002 -- HIST-036],2.91,3.17,2.31,-1.0,2.79,-1.0,-1.0,78

PARIS IN FILM,null,44239,/courses/44239,Latter-day examples like Christophe Honore's Dans Paris Cedric Klapisch's Paris or the international omnibus Paris je t'aime (with each director paying homage to a distinctive arrondissement of the capital) not to mention American blockbusters like The Da Vinci Code and Inception or Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris are there to remind us that there is something special -- indeed a special kind of magic -- about Paris in and on film. Despite the extreme polarization between Paris and provincial France in both cultural and socio-economic terms cultural historians have argued that Paris is a symbol of France (as a centralized nation) more than Rome is of Italy and much more than Madrid is of Spain or Berlin of Germany for example. The prevalence of the City of Lights on our screens Gallic and otherwise should therefore come as no surprise be it as a mere backdrop or as a character in its own right. But how exactly are the French capital and its variegated people captured on celluloid? Can we find significant differences between French and non-French approaches or between films shot on location that have the ring of authenticity and studio-bound productions using reconstructed sets? Do these representations vary through time and perhaps reflect specific historical periods or zeitgeists?,[FREN-386 -- CIMS-386],2.67,2.82,2.5,-1.0,2.86,-1.0,-1.0,30

THE BIBLE IN MOVIES,null,43202,/courses/43202,In this course we will explore how the Bible comes to life on the silver screen. For millennia scripture has been subject to various forms of interpretation all aimed at extracting meaning from this essentially multi-vocal text. Transferring an ancient text like the Bible to a contemporary medium like film requires a similar process of interpretation as modern audiences expect to be presented with a meaningful movie that contains a coherent plot. In order to illustrate the selective process by which biblical narratives are turned into Hollywood epics we will avail ourselves of biblical criticism and film theory. A close reading of biblical texts in conjunction with the movies they inspired will help us appreciate the rich nature of storytelling in the Bible. Furthermore it will allow us to explore the different ways in which the message of the Bible has been made relevant in a largely secular society. In this course we will watch David and Bathsheba The Ten Commandments Samson and Delilah Ruth The Prince of Egypt Exodus Noah and many others.,[NELC-253 -- JWST-238 -- RELS-253 -- CIMS-253],2.65,2.91,1.13,-1.0,2.13,-1.0,-1.0,23

WORLD MUSICS & CULTURES,null,43176,/courses/43176,This course examines how we as consumers in the Western world engage with musical difference largely through the products of the global entertainment industry. We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways-- particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live meaningful person-to-person music making by examining the music in its original site of production and then considering its transformation once it is removed and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of World Music by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with or using the music of peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production distribution and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.

This course will study the often fraught negotiation between representation and planning. The hyper-urbanization of China over the past several decades has radically altered traditional conceptions of public space in China. Mass migration from rural to urban areas has meant very high population densities in Chinese cities. Traditional courtyards surrounded by housing and other modestly scaled buildings are rapidly disappearing incongruent with the demands of heated property development Moreover Chinese cities have comparatively little public green space per resident compared to equivalents in the West. Zoning in Chinese cities is also much more varied for any given area than what one would find in cities such as New York Paris and London. Intensifying density of urban areas precludes the construction of large public squares.

THE NOVEL AND MARRIAGE,null,40086,/courses/40086,Historians have argued that early novels helped shape public opinion on many controversial issues. And no subject was nore often featured in novels than marriage. In the course of the 18th and the 19th centuries at a time when marriage as an institution was being radically redefined almost all the best known novels explored happy as well as unhappy unions individuals who decided not to marry as well as those whose lives were destroyed by the institution. They showcased marriage in other words in ways certain to provoke debate. We will both survey the development of the modern novel from the late 17th to the early 20th century and study the treatment of marriage in some of the greatest novels of all time. We will begin with novels from the French and English traditions the national literatures in which the genre first took shape in particular Laclos' DANGEROUS LIAISONS Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE Bronte's JANE EYRE Flaubert's MADAME BOVERY. We will then turn to works from the other European traditions such as Goethe's ELECTIVE AFFINITIES and Tolstoy's ANNA KARENINA. We will begin the course by discussing the novel often referred to as the first modern novel THE PRINCESS DE CLEVES. This was also the first novel centered on an exploration of questions centrla to the debate,[GSWS-536 -- FREN-537 -- COML-546 -- HIST-537 -- ENGL-546],3.5,3.3,3.0,-1.0,3.0,-1.0,-1.0,11

TAXES AND BUS STRATEGY,null,39474,/courses/39474,The objective of this course is to develop a framework for understanding how taxes affect business decisions. Traditional finance and strategy courses do not consider the role of taxes. Similarly traditional tax courses often ignore the richness of the decision context in which tax factors operate. The key themes of the framework - all parties all taxes and all costs - are applied to decision contexts such as investments compensation organizational form regulated industries financial instruments tax-sheltered investments mergers and acquisitions multinational and multistate. The ultimate goal is to provide a new approach to thinking about taxes (and all forms of government intervention) that will be valuable even as laws and governments change.,[ACCT-897],3.5,3.58,3.5,3.2,2.8,2.9,3.2,13

CLEAN WATER-GREEN CITIES,null,37120,/courses/37120,This course will provide an overview of the cross-disciplinary fields of civil engineering environmental sciences urban hydrology landscape architecture green building public outreach and politics. Students will be expected to conduct field investigations review scientific data and create indicator reports working with stakeholders and presenting the results at an annual symposium. There is no metaphor like water itself to describe the cumulative effects of our practices with every upstream action having an impact downstream. In our urban environment too often we find degraded streams filled with trash silt weeds and dilapidated structures. The water may look clean but is it? We blame others but the condition of the creeks is directly related to how we manage our water resources and our land. In cities these resources are often our homes our streets and our communities. This course will define the current issues of the urban ecosystem and how we move toward managing this system in a sustainable manner. We will gain an understanding of the dynamic reciprocal relationship between practices in an watershed and its waterfront. Topics discussed include: drinking water quality and protection green infrastructure urban impacts of climate change watershed monitoring public education creating strategies and more.,[ENVS-410],3.63,3.38,2.5,-1.0,2.83,-1.0,-1.0,8
WRITING SEMINAR IN NELC: MUMMIES PYRAMIDS PHARAOH,null,42261,/courses/42261,Hieroglyphs magic and buried treasure! Fascination with ancient Egypt has existed for millennia with ancient Greeks and Romans even creating Egyptianized art and adopting Egyptian deities to their pantheon. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt led to new archaeological discoveries like the Rosetta Stone and a revival of Egyptian architecture. The Victorian era was filled with mummy unwrapping parties and black market trade of artifacts robbed from tombs. The 1922 archaeological discovery of the undisturbed tomb of King Tutankhamun unleashed a frenzied wave of modern Egyptomania. Golden treasures ancient curses and the mysterious deaths of the tombs' archaeologists proved irresistible. These discoveries inspired Egyptian motifs in New York's Chrysler Building authors like Agatha Christie and movies like Cleopatra and The Mummy. And colossal Egyptian obelisks and sphinxes were even shipped across the Atlantic to display to the eager public of London and Philadelphia. This course links the study of ancient societies and modern experiencers in a way that invites critical thought. Students will examine how archaeology and the ancient world inspire today's media art architecture and more.,[WRIT-068],1.94,2.75,2.36,-1.0,3.5,-1.0,-1.0,16

THE CHILD IN THE CITY,null,37973,/courses/37973,This course examines the problem of the child in urban space in 19th and 20th century European and American discourses. This course does not propose to recover the subjective experience of the child but rather views the child as an object around which numerous adult anxieties connected to industrialization urbanization and modernity itself cohered. Discourses on public health environmental pollution sexuality criminality and racial degeneration all focused their attention anxieties and energies on how to deal with the unique vulnerability of the child in modern urban space.

MAKING SPACE AND PUBLIC ART,null,37182,/courses/37182,The French social philosopher Michel de Certeau upset the common understanding of the relationship between space and place by elevating space as practice place. By this he meant that place is but a set of geo-physical particularities that has no dynamic meaning unless activated through social engagement so that space is produced. Spatial practice is a key concept in the modern understanding of the city as a society of abstract space one in which the problem of human alienation is riven with the logic of spatial spectacularization. Public Art is often employed to address or mollify such urban problems through concepts of historical reconstruction or institutional critique including possibly testing the limits of public expression. Historical markers play a somewhat different role by calling attention to lost or negative histories albeit most often vetted through the language of tourism factoids. This course will examine the discursive issues at play in respect to art and markers particularly for Philadelphia. Additionally important public art works from around the world will be examined. The course will also include the occasional visit of several key works downtown in which the question of what can and cannot said will be pondered.,[FNAR-330 -- FNAR-530],3.54,3.62,3.0,3.7,2.4,3.1,3.6,13

Modern Catholic Christianity,null,42073,/courses/42073,At the turn of the twentieth century Sigmund Freud hypothesized that religion was a dead duck. Many other thinkers of modernity have agreed with his thesis; and yet over a century later it is clear that religion is still a forceful presence in human culture. One religious tradition that has survived to the surprise (and even consternation) of some critics is Roman Catholic Christianity. This Freshman Seminar will look closely at the Catholic Church in the twenty-first century to explore the ways in which Catholicism has (and has not) adapted to modernity. We will begin with an investigation into the history of Roman Catholicism; how it is defined and how it developed in relation to politics and culture in the Roman Empire medieval and early moder Europe and in the Americas; but most of the semester will focus on the Catholic Church of the past 200 years especially as it appears in the United States. We will consider the relationship of Catholicism to many aspects of modern life including science and technology political systems and leaders aesthetics (visual arts music literature and film) and understandings of gender and sexuality. There will be a mid-term examination and a final paper of 6 to 10 pages.,[RELS-033],2.23,2.77,1.0,-1.0,1.25,-1.0,-1.0,13

NEIGHBRHD DYN. OF CRIME,null,35566,/courses/35566,Crime varies in time space and populations as it reflects ecological structures and the routine social interactions that occur in daily life. Concentrations of crime can be found among locations with antisocial activities like assaults and theft occurring at higher rates because of the demographic make-up of people (e.g. adolescents) or conflicts (e.g. competing gangs) for reasons examined by ecological criminology. Variation in socio-demographic structures (age education ratios and the concentration of poverty) and the physical environment (housing segregation density of bars street lighting) predicts variations between neighborhoods in the level of crime and disorder. Both ethnographic and quantitative research methods are used to explore the connections between the social and physical environment of areas and antisocial behavior.,[CRIM-280 -- URBS-280],2.78,3.0,2.53,-1.0,2.47,-1.0,-1.0,19

Looking back we can see that much of the art making of the past 60 years has also been defined by this medium regardless of the form it takes. Photographic images have inspired countless paintings appeared in combines and installations morphed into sculptures drawings and performances and served both as the object and the vehicle of institutional critique. They are also an increasinglyimportant exhibition site: where most of us go to see earthworks happenings and body-art.

MAGIC IN THE BIBLE,null,43204,/courses/43204,The Bible prohibits magic and divination on several occasions. At the same time however modern commentators have repeatedly argued that many of the cultic regulations in the Bible could qualify as magical. Likewise certain characters in the Bible as for instance Jacob Josef Moses Elijah and Elisha carry out activities which may also fall under the rubric of magic. How can we reconcile the biblical prohibitions against magic with the scholarly view that certain regulations and narratives of the Bible seem to condone and even prescribe magical practices? In this course we will explore the manner in which the Bible differentiates between magic and religion. Various definitions of magic will be discussed and applied to the biblical text. In this context we will take into account the cultural and historical diversity of the world described in the Bible. After having established that the understanding of magic and its relation to religion depends on the setting and genre of the biblical text we will evaluate how biblical regulations concerning magic were received and implemented. This will be done by examining both extra-biblical writings and archaeological artifacts that correlate with the composition and canonization of the Bible.

FROM OIL FIELDS TO SOCCER FIELDS: THE MIDDLE EAST IN THE 20TH CENTURY,null,44309,/courses/44309,How did the Middle East become modern? This seemingly simple question requires a complex appraisal of civic society. Life changed in spectacular ways for the denizens of the Middle East in the span of a century.

Movie theaters sewage systems and public housing projects changed the urban backdrop of Middle Eastern cities and towns. Soccer swimming and volleyball became some of the new-fangled sports embraced by Middle Eastern communities. This course will traverse these fascinating and fraught cultural transformations of the Middle East in the twentieth century. Although inclusive of the military battles and conflicts that have affected the region this class will move beyond the cliches of war to show the range of issues and ideas with which intellectuals and communities grappled. The cultural politics and economic value of oil as well as the formation of a vibrant literary life will be among the topics covered.

Duties & Consequences,null,36331,/courses/36331,As an account of the standard of right conduct consequentialism is sometimes said to be the view that the rightness of an act is determined entirely by the value of its consequences. Since the 1970s consequentialism and its most widely-endorsed version utilitarianism have been the subjects of a number of influential critiques. Philosophers have contended that consequentialism cannot account for the distinctive values of justice and fairness for the significance of character for the agent-relativity of some moral demands and for the action-guiding function that moral theories are thought to possess. These critiques recommend a close study of the alternative deontological ethical framework from which many of these critiques originate a framework contending that the right is prior to the good in John Rawls words. But these critiques have also prompted spirited responses from consequentialists and sophisticated modifications to their theories; these responses are also worth exploring. The focus of this course is to consider and assess some of the important strands in this debate including the suggestion that neither moral framework adequately captures human concerns about morality and value.,[PHIL-202],3.29,3.43,2.57,-1.0,2.43,-1.0,-1.0,7

RELIGIOUS SACRIFICE,null,44874,/courses/44874,Sacrifice or the presentation of sacred offerings to the gods is one of the most common activities in all religious traditions. The presence of sacrifice throughout history and across cultures has led many scholars to suggest that this type of ritual encapsulates the essence of religious behavior. Understanding sacrifice is thus an important factor of understanding religion and any explanation of sacrifice is a theory of religion in miniature. This class will introduce students to influential anthropological sociological and psychological theories of sacrifice from early depictions of sacrifice as an act of commercial exchange between humans and superhuman agents to more recent theories that stress the role of sacrifice as a political device for augmenting power relations within society. We will test these theories by applying them to several case studies derived from Asian religions such as the Indian Yajna fire ritual the Chinese ancestral sacrifice and the self-sacrifice of the Bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism. Our study of both theory and practice will help us better understand the persistent presence of sacrifice from antiquity to the modern day.,[RELS-016],2.95,3.11,1.64,-1.0,1.45,-1.0,-1.0,21

LOVE&LOSS:JPNS LIT TRAD,null,37001,/courses/37001,How do people make sense of the multiple experiences that the simple words love and loss imply? How do they express their thoughts and feelings to one another? In this course we will explore some means Japanese culture has found to grapple with these events and sensations. We will also see how these culturally sanctioned frameworks have shaped the ways Japanese view love and loss. Our materials will sample the literary tradition of Japan from earliest times to the early modern and even modern periods. Close readings of a diverse group of texts including poetry narrative theater and the related arts of calligraphy painting and music will structure our inquiry. The class will take an expedition to nearby Woodlands Cemetery to experience poetry in nature. By the end of the course you should be able to appreciate texts that differ slightly in their value systems linguistic expressions and aesthetic sensibilities from those that you may already know. Among the available project work that you may select if you have basic Japanese is learning to read a literary manga.

STRATEGIC REASONING,null,36370,/courses/36370,This course is about strategically interdependent decisions. In such situations the outcome of your actions depends also on the actions of others. When making your choice you have to think what the others will choose who in turn are thinking what you will be choosing and so on. Game Theory offers several concepts and insights for understanding such situations and for making better strategic choices. This course will introduce and develop some basic ideas from game theory using illustrations applications and cases drawn from business economics politics sports and even fiction and movies. Some interactive games will be played in class. There will be little formal theory and the only pre-requisites are some high-school algebra and having taken Econ 1. However general numeracy (facility interpreting and doing numerical graphs tables and arithmetic calculations) is very important. This course will also be accepted by the Economics department as an Econ course to be counted toward the minor in Economics (or as an Econ elective).,[PPE-201 -- ECON-013],2.23,2.4,2.89,-1.0,2.69,-1.0,-1.0,138

NAT&CULT HER GLOBAL PERS,null,42343,/courses/42343,This seminar will explore the ideas surrounding the theories discourses and practices surrounding natural and cultural heritage. Heritage has become inscribed in the planning of urban and rural landscapes designed as tourist destinations and considered a universal good in global cosmopolitan society. But it would be well to ask: what kind of nature and culture has been labeled as heritage? What kind of organizations economics and politics are necessary to sustain it? How are these put in place? By whom? For whom? Over the course of the semester students will engage with readings that discuss how cultural and natural heritage is communicated to the public and the relationship between academic critique and pragmatic social engagement. This seminar is further grounded by a partnership between the Penn Cultural Heritage Center and the U.S. Mission to UNESCO focused on the assessment of World Heritage Sites and students will have the opportunity to learn from and participate in specific case studies.,[ANTH-593],2.91,3.09,2.33,-1.0,2.22,-1.0,-1.0,11
HISTORY OF TECHNOLOGY,null,42978,/courses/42978,In this course we read influential classic and recent works in the history and the philosophy of technology tackling the ways in which the fields are analytically structured as well as their relation to each other. We also discuss approaches and methodological questions in general history and general philosophy. We start with Karl Marx arguably the most influential historian and philosopher of technology of the modern era and discuss him in relation to what has been one of the most visible debates in the historiography of technology - the question of technological determinism. We then travel in a roughly chronological order through key periods and methodological issues in the fields. During our journey we encounter the Middle Ages and historical theoreticians of the Annales School the early modern period and questions about gender and microhistory and the so-called Industrial Revolution and the questions it raises about what's modern about modern technology. Mid- way through the class we discuss two classics in the philosophy of technology Martin Heidegger and Ju?rgen Habermas who grapple precisely with the question about the modern element in industrial technology.,[HSSC-564],3.08,3.54,2.7,-1.0,3.1,-1.0,-1.0,14
TOPICS IN CULTURAL HIST: MAKING AND MARKING TIME,null,38689,/courses/38689,Topic for Spring 2016: Making and Marking Time. What is time? In the late 19th century the questions of how to define time how to slow down time and above all how to accelerate movement have become focus of the work by many European philosophers who have tried to come to terms with what is now termed as the Industrial Revolution and the idea of progress. And can time be understood as something continuous or is it fragmented proceeding in fits and burst? Such contemplations on time have deeply influenced writers. Marcel Proust was a reader of Henri Bergson and translated his theories of time into a concept of memory. Thomas Mann has tried to navigate timelessness in a novel set on a Magic Mountain. Virginia Woolf and James Joyce have pictured an entire universe in a single day (Mrs. Dalloway Ulysses) while early 20th century Italian Futurists made the contemplation of time part of their manifestos. With them and with expressionist writers in Germany or writers from the DADA movement there elsewhere in Europe a reckoning with time would also influence their choice of genre and form writerly practice and technique.,[GRMN-541 -- COML-537 -- ARTH-584 -- ENGL-563],3.3,3.63,2.48,-1.0,2.7,-1.0,-1.0,24
NONPROFIT SECTOR: ECONOM,null,42405,/courses/42405,The nonprofit sector plays a key role in the provision of many goods and services which are fundamental in our society and which may be difficult to provide using market mechanisms alone. Education health care charitable services and the arts are some primary examples of these. Nonprofit organizations operate in service of specific social missions rather than profit maximization but in order to serve those missions effectively while ensuring their own survival they must also make many of the decisions typically associated with private firms. That is they must compete for funding human resources and consumers of their services they must manage and invest their resources efficiently and they must innovate new products and services over time. Importantly the latter requirements may at times come in conflict with the organizations' social values. As a result nonprofit organizations as economic decision-makers confront a number of unique challenges to their success and growth. The goal of this course is to give students a broad overview of the economic organizational and strategic concerns facing the non-profit sector. Our objective is to characterize the unique economic environment identify effective strategic governance and management approaches and explore how appropriate measurement techniques can,[BEPP-214],2.76,2.94,1.36,2.71,1.5,2.21,2.71,17

SEX & HUMAN NATURE,null,39515,/courses/39515,This is an introduction to the scientific study of sex in humans. Within an evolutionary framework the course examines genetic physiological ecological social and behavioral aspects of sex in humans. After providing the basic principles of evolutionary biology the course will examine the development of sexual anatomy and physiology. How is sex determined? How is orgasm achieved? Why do girls and boys develop sexually at different ages? The role of ecology and social life in shaping human mating patterns will be evaluated through the use of ethnographies and cross-cultural materials on a variety of human cultures. Does everybody have sex the way we do? Why marry? Are there biological bases for love? Why do we experience jealousy? Finally topics relevant to human sexuality today will be discussed such as recreational sex contraception and sexually transmitted diseases. Examples are drawn primarily from traditional and modern human societies; data from studies of nonhuman primates are also considered.,[ANTH-104 -- GSWS-103 -- BIBB-150],1.76,1.86,2.55,-1.0,2.32,-1.0,-1.0,232
Behavioral Economics & Psychology: Theory & Experiments,null,40988,/courses/40988,In reality our understanding of different mechanisms and (economic) relations ips is hampered by the lack of data. More often than not either the observat observation itself is difficult or the data is not reliable. Over the last de decades economic experiments have become a vital part of the scientific disco discourse facilitating our understanding of the world we live in (much like i Biology Chemistry Physics or the like). Economic experiments allow explorin economic behavior under controlled conditions by generating observations under controlled conditions by generating observations under different experimental designs and controlled conditions. Pioneering this field of research Daniel Kahneman and Vernon Smith were awarded the Nobel memorial prize in recognition of their work on behavioral and experimental economics. In this course provide you with the methodology of how to develop a research idea and a prope experimental design that allows to explore this idea.

MARKETS FOR PURE RISK,null,35370,/courses/35370,The increased frequency and severity of pure risk events hinders corporations' abilities to execute strategy and deliver sustainable financial results to stakeholders. Prominent recent examples include disruptions from Hurricane Katrina Japan's earthquake/nuclear disaster/supply chain breakdowns Thai floods U.S. wildfires and global terrorist attacks. At the same time both industrialized and emerging economies understand that the management and financing of pure risk is critical to the success of their economies. Consequently the rising demand for risk capital has ushered in several capital market innovations and public/private partnerships necessary for managing and financing pure risk. This course investigates these issues beginning with an introduction to pure risks their centers of gravity and global consequences for corporations consumers and the macroeconomies. Next we move on to traditional sources of risk capital provided to corporations and governments via insurance and reinsurance mechanisms. The course concludes with a discussion of new sources of risk capital provided by capital markets including catastrophic risk bonds securitization of mortality and liability risk and other forms of insurance-linked securities.,[BEPP-812],3.5,3.55,1.88,3.25,1.83,2.88,3.13,11

PERSIAN HERITAGE SPKRS I: READING AND WRITING,null,37732,/courses/37732,An intensive course designed to teach the reading and writing of standard Tehran Persian to those with a speaking knowledge of that language. In recent years there has been an increasing demand from Persian-speaking Iranian-American students for formal instruction in Persian. While many of these students have some degree of spoken fluency in Persian they are often unable to read or write it. Their speaking ability makes it difficult to integrate them into first- or second-year classes of students who have started with no knowledge of Persian. If these Persian-speaking students could be brought to at least a second-year level of reading and writing they could then be enrolled in more advanced courses in Persian where they would be more or less at the same level as other students. The course will focus on the lexical and syntactic differences between written and spoken Persian and the problems of Persian spelling.,[PERS-017 -- PERS-617],2.0,3.0,1.67,-1.0,2.0,-1.0,-1.0,3

1000 YRS MUSICAL LISTENG,null,36178,/courses/36178,We know that we like music and that it moves us yet it is often difficult to pinpoint exactly why and harder still to explain what it is we are hearing. This course takes on those issues. It aims to introduce you to a variety of music and a range of ways of thinking talking and writing about music. The majority of music dealt with will be drawn from the so-called Classical repertory from the medieval period to the present day including some of the 'greats' such as Handel Beethoven Mozart Berlioz and Verdi but will also introduce you to music you will most likely never have encountered before. This course will explore the technical workings of music and the vocabularies for analyzing music and articulating a response to it; it also examines music as a cultural phenomenon considering what music has meant for different people from different societies across the ages and across geographical boundaries. As well as learning to listen ourselves we will also engage with a history of listening. No prior musical knowledge is required. (Formerly Music 021),[MUSC-030],2.65,2.9,2.06,-1.0,1.82,-1.0,-1.0,20

UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE: FROM THE TOWER OF BABEL TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,null,44891,/courses/44891,This is a course in European intellectual history. It explores the historical trajectory from antiquity to the present day of the idea that there once was and again could be a universal and perfect language among the human race. If recovered it can explain the origins and meaning of human experience and can enable universal understanding and world peace. The tantalizing question of the possibility of a universal language have been vital and thought-provoking throughout the history of humanity. The idea that the language spoken by Adam and Eve was a language which perfectly expressed the nature of all earthly objects and concepts has occupied the minds of intellectuals for almost two millennia. In defiance of the Christian biblical myth of the confusion of languages and nations at the Tower of Babel they have over and over tried to overcome divine punishment and discover the path back to harmonious existence. By recovering or recreating a universal language theologians hoped to be able to experience the divine; philosophers believed that it would enable apprehension of the laws of nature while mystic cabbalists saw in it direct access to hidden knowledge.,[RUSS-095 -- COML-095 -- HIST-056 -- ENGL-219],4.0,4.0,2.67,-1.0,2.67,-1.0,-1.0,3

Some members of the church have been associated with governments and those in power in order to exert control and domination over the population. Others have been among the few individuals or institutions that have spoken up against the injustices and oppression both of colonial governments in the 16th to 18th centuries and of authoritarian regimes of independent republics in the 19th and 20th centuries. In this latter period our analysis will include the churchs role in defending human civil political and indigenous rights and in promoting the transition from the period of military or civilian dictatorships that ruled a good part of the region starting in the 1960s to civilian democratic regimes in the 1980s and 1990s.

NEEDFINDING,null,41603,/courses/41603,Needfinding is an approach that puts people and their needs at the center of product development and business strategy creation. Over 90% of new products introduced into the marketplace fail. A good portion of these failures are due to lack of understanding of end consumers and their needs. To develop truly successful new products it's not enough just to ask people what they need or want. Designers and engineers need tools and techniques to get beyond what people can explicitly state and determine their implicit needs. Needfinding is an approach for developing deep insights that provide strategic direction for corporations and open up new possibilities for product development. In this class students will gain a toolset from which to develop their own approaches to conducting researching for design: learning how to think about other people about culture and about new perspectives. They will also learn tactical skills: how to define research questions how to conduct observations and interviews how to interpret results how to synthesize them into fodder for design and how to communicate their findings in a way that is compelling and actionable for designers marketers and business strategists.,[IPD-509],2.5,2.63,1.8,2.25,2.35,2.32,2.65,25

HIST FOREIGN AID IN AFRC,null,38753,/courses/38753,This course examines the history politics and significance of foreign aid to Africa since the late 19th century. While we do not typically think about the European colonial period in Africa in terms of 'foreign aid' that era introduced ideas and institutions which formed the foundations for modern aid policies and practices. So we start there and move forward into more contemporary times. In addition to examining the objectives behind foreign assistance and the intentions of donors and recipients we will look at some of the consequences (intended or unintended) of various forms of foreign aid to Africa over the past century. While not designed to be a comprehensive history of development theory of African economics or of international aid organizations the course will touch on all of these topics. Previous course work on Africa is strongly advised.,[HIST-372 -- AFST-372],2.59,2.76,2.14,-1.0,2.5,-1.0,-1.0,18

MACHINE FOR SEEING: ARCHITECTURE AND THE MOVING IMAGE,null,42763,/courses/42763,Architecture's relationship with cinema was established with the very first motion picture. In Sortie de l'usine Lumiere de Lyon by Auguste and Louis Lumiere we see a didactic presentation of film titles as workers from the Lumiere brother's factory stream forth from its interior at days end. In many ways the context of the film is its subject as well. The title of the class plays on Le Corbusier's maxim that architecture is machine for living and perhaps cinema is simply a machine for helping us understand the vast construct of our built environment. A device which allows us to imagine even greater follies or more importantly to think critically about architecture's relationship with and impact on society. Readings screenings discussions and critiques make up the curriculum along with studio time. Students will produce their own film and we will look at films produced by a range of practioners: From architects speculating on the nature of and use of public space and urban development to documentarians researching the pathologies of neo-liberalism and its effect on the privatization of space. We will also look at the work of artists who engage with the poetics of space and who unpack the conflicted legacies of the built environment.,[FNAR-073 -- FNAR-673],3.33,3.33,2.6,3.4,2.8,3.2,3.2,6

WORLD LITERATURE,null,43948,/courses/43948,How do we think 'the world' as such? Globalizing economic paradigms encourage one model that while it connects distant regions with the ease of a finger-tap also homogenizes the world manufacturing patterns of sameness behind simulations of diversity. Our current world-political situation encourages another model in which fundamental differences are held to warrant the consolidation of borders between Us and Them our world and theirs. This course begins with the proposal that there are other ways to encounter the world that are politically compelling ethically important and personally enriching--and that the study of literature can help tease out these new paths. Through the idea of World Literature this course introduces students to the appreciation and critical analysis of literary texts with the aim of navigating calls for universality or particularity (and perhaps both) in fiction and film. World literature here refers not merely to the usual definition of books written in places other than the US and Europe but any form of cultural production that explores and pushes at the limits of a particular world that steps between and beyond worlds or that heralds the coming of new worlds still within us waiting to be born.

SCHELLINGGOETHENATURE,null,42894,/courses/42894,Although the starting point for the Anthropocne is still under discussion there is broad agreement that the industrial revolution and the turn to fossil fuels mark an intensification of humanity's impact on the Earth. It may not be a coincidence that Kant's proclamation of the Copernican revolution in philosophy according to which human reason replaces the natural light of traditional metaphysics falls roughly in the same period. Human finite cognition became the measure for God and his creation. The dawn of the era of human freedom and the ramped up exploitation of resources coincide. It is against this background that the Naturphilosophie of F. W. J. Schelling can become particularly interesting. The genesis of German idealism is closely related with the opposition between freedom and necessity that lies at the heart of Kant's critical project. Kant associated the former with man and the latter with nature. In trying to bridge the gap between them Schelling reinstates nature as an autonomous actor in its own right. Schelling's thinking about nature chimed with the literary and empirical-scientific work of his contemporary Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.,[GRMN-525 -- PHIL-567 -- COML-547],2.89,2.67,2.67,-1.0,2.33,-1.0,-1.0,9

Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior powerand experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender in contrast emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice.

The extent to which the allegations of misogyny and promulgation of a patriarchal power structure can be traced back to the Bible will be investigated in this course. This is done by investigating the role women play in the narratives and legal materials found in the Bible. Utilizing modern biblical criticism we analyze stories such as the expulsion from Eden the matriarchs and the rape of Dinah. We also examine the status of women as sisters wives and mothers while taking into consideration the contributions women made to prophecy and leadership.

NETWKING THEORY & FUND,null,42748,/courses/42748,Networks constitute an important component of modern technology and society. Networks have traditionally dominated communication technology in form of communication networks distribution of energy in form of power grid networks and have more recently emerged as a tool for social connectivity in form of social networks. In this course we will study mathematical techniques that are key to the design and analysis of different kinds of networks. First we will investigate techniques for modeling evolution of networks. Specifically we will consider random graphs (all or none connectivity size of components diameters under random connectivity) small world problem network formation and the role of topology in the evolution of networks. Next we will investigate different kinds of stochastic processes that model the flow of information in networks. Specifically we will develop the theory of markov processes renewal processes and basic queueing diffusion models epidemics and rumor spreading in networks.,[ESE-501],2.8,3.2,2.5,2.75,2.0,2.0,2.75,6

This seminar will explore the modern mediated ritual of apology and forgiveness asking in particular who gets to apologize who is asked to forgive and what the difference is between these two processes. Drawing on theoretical literature in feminist philosophy of language media ritual journalism studies meme and celebrity studies and political communication we will consider a series of case studies to think about how apologies and forgiveness work and when and if these two processes should be separated. Starting with recent cases of police shootings and survivors of sexual assault and moving to politics and celebrities we will pay particular attention to requests for forgiveness in absence of apology thinking about which kinds of bodies and what kind of victims bear the burden of being publicly forgiving and what kinds of power dynamics are at stake in the process of granting forgiveness in the absence of apology.,[COMM-490],2.96,3.52,2.43,3.1,2.48,2.71,3.24,23

Music and Literature: Sounding Poetry,null,45143,/courses/45143,Never before has poetry been so inescapable. Hip hop the soundtrack of our times has made rhyme meter and word-play part of our daily lives. How did this happen? This course begins not on the page but in the bardic traditions of Homer's Iliad which encoded many of the values of its time in oral formulas. Poetry was however no mere encyclopedia but also a source of risk as we will read in Plato's warning against its hypnotic powers and in the excesses of the Bacchae. We continue through 19th and 20th century attempts to recover these classic traditions (Wordsworth Longfellow Pound). Yet Europe was not the only center of poetic production. How does the Homeric tradition relate to living traditions of West African singing poets (griots) and Southern African praise songs? And what traces of these traditions can we hear in the blues? We will listen to early blues recordings and discuss the politics of collecting folklore and the genius of African American modernists (Langston Hughes Claude McKay Georgia Douglas Johnson) who bought vernacular speech onto the page. We will read and listen to a number of 20th century poets inspired when page meets stage in jazz poetry dub poetry spoken word and hip hop.

DRESS & FASHION IN AFRCA,null,40889,/courses/40889,Throughout Africa social and cultural identities of ethnicity gender generation rank and status were conveyed in a range of personal ornamentation that reflects the variation of African cultures. The meaning of one particular item of clothing can transform completely when moved across time and space. As one of many forms of expressive culture dress shape and give forms to social bodies. In the study of dress and fashion we could note two distinct broad approaches the historical and the anthropological. While the former focuses on fashion as a western system that shifted across time and space and linked with capitalism and western modernity; the latter approach defines dress as an assemblage of modification the body. The Africanist proponents of this anthropological approach insisted that fashion is not a dress system specific to the west and not tied with the rise of capitalism. This course will focus on studying the history of African dress by discussing the forces that have impacted and influenced it overtime such as socio-economic colonialism religion aesthetics politics globalization and popular culture.

RACE/SEX DISCRIMINATION: Race and Sex Discrimination,null,44930,/courses/44930,This course is concerned with the structure the causes and correlates and the government policies to alleviate discrimination by race and gender in the United States. The central focus of the course is on employment differences by race and gender and the extent to which they arise from labor market discrimination versus other causes although racial discrimination in housing is also considered. After a comprehensive overview of the structures of labor and housing markets and of nondiscriminatory reasons (that is the cumulative effects of past discrimination and/or experiences) for the existence of group differentials in employment wages and residential locations various theories of the sources of current discrimination are reviewed and evaluated. Actual government policies and alternatives policies are evaluated in light of both the empirical evidence on group differences and the alternative theories of discrimination.,[SOCI-112 -- GSWS-114 -- AFRC-112],2.71,2.64,2.0,-1.0,2.06,-1.0,-1.0,28

MID EAST WATER IN HIST,null,41814,/courses/41814,The role of water in the Middle East cannot be overstated. The Middle East is an arid region but human and natural systems have interacted to determine relative water scarcity and abundance at different times and places. The location accessibility yield and quality of natural and managed water resources significantly influenced the location and longevity of ancient and modern settlements. Control of water has always affected the economic political social life of the communities inhabiting these settlements.

WAR AND REPRESENTATION:  WAR TRAUMA AND REPRESENTATION IN LITERATURE,null,45127,/courses/45127,This class will explore complications of representing war in the 20th and 21st centuries. War poses problems of perception knowledge and language. The notional fog of war describes a disturbing discrepancy between agents and actions of war; the extreme nature of the violence of warfare tests the limits of cognition emotion and memory; war's traditional dependence on declaration is often warped by language games--police action military intervention nation-building or palpably unnamed and unacknowledged state violence. Faced with the radical uncertainty that forms of war bring modern and contemporary authors have experimented in historically geographically experientially and artistically particular ways forcing us to reconsider even seemingly basic definitions of what a war story can be. Where does a war narrative happen? On the battlefield in the internment camp in the suburbs in the ocean in the ruins of cities in the bloodstream? Who narrates war? Soldiers refugees gossips economists witnesses bureaucrats survivors children journalists descendants and inheritors of trauma historians those who were never there? How does literature respond to the rise of terrorist or ideology war the philosophical and material consequences of biological and cyber wars the role of the nuclear state?

LAW & VIOLENCE,null,41228,/courses/41228,This course will be an exploration of premodern Japanese history through the lens of violence. The centuries under consideration (roughly the eighth thought nineteenth) were characterized by greatly varying levels of violence both of the state-sanctioned variety (war punishments for law-breakers and political losers) and of the non-sanctioned variety (piracy banditry warrior and peasant rebellions). Examining a wide variety of translated sources from diaries to chronicles from legal codes to fiction we shall examine the changing social political economic and cultural contexts of violence in order to interrogate not only why certain periods were remarkably peaceful while others were not but also why violence took different forms in relation to different circumstances. We shall consider how contempories made sense of the violence that surrounded them (or didn't) and how they divided the acceptable use of force from the wanton and society-threatening abuse of it. The course will feature presentations and severl (very short) papers.,[EALC-264 -- EALC-664],3.0,4.0,1.67,-1.0,2.0,-1.0,-1.0,4

HISTORY OF INDIAN BUSINESS,null,39299,/courses/39299,With annual growth rates between 5-10 percent for much of the last fifteen years it may seem that the turn of the millennium has marked a fundamental shift in the state of Indian business. Yet at the same time stories continue to abound about the dark side of India's recent shining where matters such as distributional justice and the fate of social strata like the subaltern poor and agrarian are concerned. Moreover broader intra-regional forces continue to affect the state of business in a way that constantly reminds us that traditionally lacked any absolutely clear cut geographical correlate. How then should we think of the history of Indian business? In what ways is such a history different from or the same as the economic history of the South Asian subcontinent its borderlands and the broader Indian Ocean world it was long connected to? Can isolating something to be thought of as business in the past illuminate the structure or challenges of what we all so intuitively think of as the financial commercial and industrial aspects of business in the present? In this course we will consider these and other questions by tracing the interactions between the three-fold forces of entrepreneurialism labor and kinship/sovereignty--considered as the underlying conditions of business activity's possibility--from ancient to modern times in South Asia.,[SAST-166 -- HIST-156],3.5,3.25,3.0,-1.0,3.0,-1.0,-1.0,4

The methodologies include those that expand the nature of the predictors (as in the use of special transformations in time series and the construction of regression trees) and allow the use of categorical reponses (logistic regression). The course concludes by exploring the relationship between a regression fit to observational data and an analysis of variance estimated from experimental data as in a conjoint analysis.,[STAT-622],3.04,3.4,2.93,3.17,2.45,2.69,3.5,50

We will explore the natures cultures and environmentalisms of cities by exploring the matter of urban water. Cities have long been made through historic projects to tame the unruly relations between land and water. As the catastrophic human disasters in Houston Florida and Puerto Rico have recently shown these relations are today everywhere being unsettled and exacerbated by climate change. In cities as diverse as Philadelphia and Mumbai climate change promises to exacerbate social inequalities and further squeeze non-human natures. How is the urban environment produced magnified divided and shrunk with water? In these times how might we make space for social justice and non-human natures in and along rising urban waters?,[ANTH-297 -- URBS-297 -- SAST-297],3.11,3.67,2.78,-1.0,2.89,-1.0,-1.0,10
PUTIN'S RUSSIA,null,40650,/courses/40650,Winston Churchill famously said that Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.

THE ART OF THE PROFILE,null,42695,/courses/42695,One of the toughest challenges for any journalist is to master the art of the profile-writing. In this new course students will read and critique some of the classic profile articles of the past 40 years and most importantly write profile articles of their own. Writing about people is often very rewarding but rarely easy. In this course students will debate the questions that have plagued and energized journalists for generations: How do you persuade somebody that he or she is a worthy topic for a profile? How do you ask sensitive questions? If the person is a celebrity how do you avoid being manipulated into writing a puff piece? Do you tape the interviews or just take notes? How do you structure a profile in order to keep the reader's attention? Is it even possible to capture the essence of a person on the written page? Are you a friend to the profile subject--or a manipulator? A journalist at The New Yorker recently said that a writer's relationship with the profile subject is a kind of love affair.

MUSIC & THE BRAIN,null,42412,/courses/42412,Every human culture that has ever been described makes some form of music. The musics of different cultures cover a wide range of styles but also display fascinating similarities and a number of features are shared by even the most disparate musical traditions. Within our own culture music is inescapable-there are very few individuals who do not listen to some form of music every day and far more who listen to music virtually all day long. Appreciation of music comes very early: newborns prefer music to normal speech and mothers all over the world sing to their babies in a fundamentally similar way. And yet despite this seeming ubiquity the real origin and purpose of music remains unknown. Music is obviously related to language but how? Why do so many cultures make music in such fundamentally similar ways? What goes into the formation of music taste and preferences? Does music have survival value or is it merely auditory cheesecake a superfluous byproduct of evolution as some critics have maintained? What is the nature of musical ability and how do musicians differ from non-musicians?,[BIBB-060],2.84,3.21,1.56,-1.0,1.56,-1.0,-1.0,19

We'll consider questions from each main branch of contemporary moral philosophy. We will start by talkiing about issues in applied ethics. Applied ethics is concerned with analyzing the moral status of very specific types of acts. Applied ethicists are interested in questions such as 'Are we morally required to give to charity?' 'Is it ever morally p ermissible to have an abortion?' and 'Is it ever morally permissible to kill a non-combatant in wartime?'. We will use underlying disagreements about applied ethics to segue into a unit on normative ethics. Normative ethics is concerned with the general features of acts that make them right wrong good or bad. Normative ethicists are interested in questions such as 'Are only the consequences of an action relevant for determining what's right and wrong?' 'Do people have moral rights?' 'What does it take for one's life to go best?' and 'What is virtue?'. We will use underlying disagreements about normative ethics to segue into our third and final unit,[PHIL-002],3.41,3.59,2.44,-1.0,2.17,-1.0,-1.0,25

The essential concept will be to employ photographs as storytelling vehicles. So we will be using curling drugstore printed Kodak shots from our own family albums. We will be using searing and famous images from history books. We will be taking things from yesterday's newspaper. We will even be using pictures that were just made by the workshop participants outside the campus gates with a disposable camera from CVS or with their own sophisticated digital Nikon. In all of this there will be one overriding aim to achieve memorable full-bodied stories. To locate the strange evocative storytelling universes that are sealed inside the four rectangular walls of photograph. They are always there if you know how to look. It's about the quality of your noticing the intensity of your seeing.,[ENGL-156],3.2,2.8,2.25,-1.0,2.25,-1.0,-1.0,11

Science confirms the glaciers are melting hurricanes are growing more intense and the oceans are rising. But there is also a deeply spiritual dimension to global warming that does not factor into the scientific explanations of the Anthropocene. Spirituality will be defined not in terms of one particular religion but in relationship to a passionate study of the environment and nature. Readings will include materials from both the sciences and the humanities such as Donella Meadows's Thinking in Systems Elizabeth Kolbert's The Sixth Extinction Barbara Kingsolver's Flight Behavior and films such as Black Fish and Wale Rider. The theoretical focus of the course will be how multispecies partnerships can help us better understand and mitigate the effects of Climate Change. This class will work collaboratively on a digital archive with an interactive mapping interface designed in Scalar. This newly developed platform allows for the creation of multimedia exhibits that will document how Global Warming is affecting coral reefs in the tropics glaciers in the Arctic and Antarctic rainforests in the Amazon and rivers of Philadelphia.

FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE: THE ROLE OF INNATE IMMUNITY IN DISEASE,null,41049,/courses/41049,All organisms from bacteria to humans rely on innate non-specific defense systems to protect against infection and mediate damage. Even in organisms that can generate highly specific and efficient adaptive responses such as humans defects in innate immune system components can be fatal. In this course we will examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the components of the innate immune system through discussion of primary literature. We will explore how the innate immune system influences the course of infections and cancer as well as autoinflammatory disorders that lead to host tissue damage. Though our focus will be on mammalian immunity we will also explore the evolutionary development of innate immunity through comparison of systems in different organisms.,[BIOL-405],3.84,3.84,2.27,-1.0,2.81,-1.0,-1.0,19

NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION: The Neurological Condition,null,43563,/courses/43563,Few aspects of our physical makeup are as closely linked to who we are as people as the nervous system. We define our selves by our capacity to think to react by our memories. In large part we believe we are our brains. Yet such perceptions have a history far deeper than our current neuro-obsessed moment. In this course we explore the neurological condition as the human condition: the growing sense since the nineteenth century that we are defined by our nervous systems and the science that has fostered this vision. From theories of diminishing nerve force and the electric cures of the Victorian era to fMRIs and Obama's 2013 BRAIN Initiative we explore how science medicine and technology have shaped our understanding of the brain and nervous system as the center of human identity. Course topics include the rise of professional neurology and neuroscience cultural meanings of nerves and the brain and the intimate role of patients and human subjects in formulating this science from the nineteenth century to the present.,[STSC-429 -- HSOC-429],2.8,3.0,2.44,-1.0,2.89,-1.0,-1.0,11

TWENTIETH CENTURY NEW YORK: THEORIES IMAGES REALITIES,null,43730,/courses/43730,New York is the perfect model of a city not the model of a perfect city. -Lewis Mumford. This course is constructed as an argument among four visionary thinkers whose differing theories of the twentieth-century city were shaped by their response to New York City's modern urban architectural and environmental development: Lewis Mumford (1895-1990) Robert Moses (1888-1981) Jane Jacobs (1916-2006) and Rem Koolhaas (1944-). The seminar explores the central problems that preoccupied each from civic representation and sustainability to large-scale infrastructure and urban renewal from community and complexity to urban experience and the urban imaginary. Readings of key texts by and about the four main figures are supplemented with related material and with case studies of New York's built environment. The class includes two trips to New York to visit selected sites. The focus is double: on the role and agency of the urban intellectual in the production of urban culture; and on New York's material history and visual representations. New York has been called the capital of the twentieth century.

DEUTSCHLAND SCHAFFT SICH AB...ODER ERFINDET SICH NEU?,null,41510,/courses/41510,Fall 2017 description: Deutschland steht aktuell vor einer Vielzahl von Herausforderungen die teils wesentlich gesellschaftliche Bereiche betreffen. Man muss davon ausgehen dass die heute getroffenen Entscheidungen die deutsche aber auch europaeische Zukunft fuer eine nicht absehbare Zeit massgeblich beeinflussen werden. Viele der verhandelten Fragen und Probleme sind zum Teil eng miteinander verwoben und erfordern zur Bewaeltigung gesamtpolitisch uebergreifende Loesungsstrategien. Diese verlangen gegebenenfalls einen tiefgreifenden gesellschaftlichen politischen und oekonomischen Wandel der bestehenden Verhaeltnisse da zum Teil grundlegende Strukturen und Ueberzeugungen weiter Teile der Bevoelkerung betroffen sind. Aus diesem Grund werden Auffassungen die lange Zeit als gesicherter Bestand des gesellschaftlichen Diskurses galten infrage gestellt. Es ist daher nicht verwunderlich dass die drohenden Veraenderungen reaktionaere Kraefte provozieren die um die Erhaltung bestehender Verhaeltnisse besorgt sind. Denn es ist zu vermuten dass der anstehende Wandel nicht alle betroffenen Gruppen besser stellen wird und vielleicht groessere Opfer erfordert als bislang eingestanden wurde.,[GRMN-381],3.7,3.8,2.44,-1.0,2.11,-1.0,-1.0,10
WHAT IS ENLIGHTENMENT?,null,41513,/courses/41513,The question What is the Enlightenment? was posed for an essay competition in a journal the Berlin Monatsschrift in 1784. At that point French and English philosophers had already considered new ways of thinking inventing the modern individual and the modern citizen (in contrast to a state's subject). German responses to this question were written by an established philosopher (Immanuel Kant) a Jewish resident of Berlin (Moses Mendelssohn) as well as concerned readers of recent philosophical treastises. In our course we will consider this question by exploring this early discussion and the formation of Enlightenment thought in Europe and specifically Germany including the German-Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) but also trace the historical transformation of this discussion including Theodor W. Adorno's and Max Horkheimer's Dialectics of Enlightenment (1944/1947) and more recent criticism.,[GRMN-556],4.0,4.0,2.0,-1.0,3.0,-1.0,-1.0,1

We will explore the idea of sexuality as a category of social identity probing the identities of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender to try and understand what they really mean in various cultural social and political milieus. In doing so we will ask: What does it mean to study queerness? What do we mean by queer studies? How do institutions - religious legal scientific - shape our understandings of queer identities? In what ways do sexuality and gender interact and how does this interaction inform the meanings of each of these identity categories? How do other social categories of identification - race ethnicity class etc. - affect the ways in which we understand expressions of queerness? What does studying queerness tell us about the workings of contemporary political cultural and social life?

READINGS IN RACE & SCIEN: Readings in Race and Science,null,41593,/courses/41593,What accounts for the persistence and resilience of racial conceptions in science? In this course we will look for answers to this and other questions by examining the historiography of race colonialism and science. The standard historiography has focused on the rise and fall of racial typologies in the north Atlantic and their contributions to troublesome political projects such as the Atlantic slave trade Jim Crow policies the eugenics movement and the Holocaust. More recent histories have taken inspiration from postcolonial studies standpoint theories and indigenous studies to insist on a more global reckoning of race and science. If we focus on the southern hemisphere for instance we can see scientific racial conceptions enrolled for a different though not necessarily less innocent set of projects: the dispossession of indigenous lands and effacement of indigenous peoples the glorification of race-mixing as a tool of nation building and the cultivation of whiteness as a means to modernity. By examining classic and recent approaches to race and science we will grapple with the following questions: Is 'race' a product of 18th century French and English science? Or can we find earlier iterations in the idioms of conquest of Spanish America during the early modern period?,[HSSC-506],3.36,3.45,2.64,-1.0,2.82,-1.0,-1.0,11

INTRO TO DATA SCIENCE,null,42011,/courses/42011,Understanding and interpreting large quantitative data sets is increasingly central in political and social science. Whether one seeks to understand political communication international trade inter-group conflict or a host of other issues the availability of large quantities of digital data has revolutionized the study of politics. Nonetheless most data-related courses focus on statistical estimation rather than on the related but distinctive problems of data acquisition management and visualization - in a term data science. This course seeks to address that imbalance by focusing squarely on the tools of data science. Leaving this course students will be able to acquire format analyze and visualize various types of political data using the statistical programming language R.

PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION,null,40531,/courses/40531,The philosophy of education asks questions about the foundational assumptions of our formal institutions for the reproduction of culture. It ranges therefore from epistemology and philosophy of mind to ethics and political philosophy. For instance: What is the nature of learning and teaching? How is it possible to come to know something we did not know already--and how can we aid others in doing that? How if at all should formal institutions of education be concerned with shaping students' moral and civic character? What is the proper relation between educational institutions and the state? We also ask questions more specific to our own time and context. For example: how in a multicultural state should we educate students of varied social identities like race gender and religion? What is the relationship between education and justice.,[PHIL-249 -- GSWS-249],4.0,4.0,3.0,-1.0,2.0,-1.0,-1.0,2
YOUTH AND DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA,null,36729,/courses/36729,In the past few decades many African nations have overthrown colonial regimes and police states in favor of some form of democratic governance. But what doesthis ideological and political shift mean for a country's youth? In this coursewe will use anthropological texts to explore the ways in which young Africans are both socialized into and also play an active role in negotiating the terms of democracy. In doing so we will look both at the great diversity in democratic ideals across the continent as well as the perceived failures of many African nations to transition to constitutional democracies. We will use a variety of examples from recent history to examine these issues such as the recent youth uprising in Egypt and its use of social media as a tool of democracy the role of youth in apartheid-era political protest in South Africa and the complex intersection of indigenous politics and democratic legislation in Tanzania. This course will engage key debates in current anthropological analysis asking about both young people's capacity for agency as well as the formation of political subjectivity.,[ANTH-266 -- AFST-266 -- AFRC-267],3.33,3.17,2.8,-1.0,2.83,-1.0,-1.0,6

SUSHI&RAMEN:GLOBAL FOOD,null,43982,/courses/43982,Who defines Japanese food? Is it the chef at a top establishment in Tokyo a home cook in Osaka a tea master in Kyoto the ancient capital? Or is it the midwestern American who thinks sushi means raw fish? Is it the person who scarfs cup noodles or the devotee of artisan ramen stock? Perhaps it is the Japanese government which in 2006 sent undercover agents abroad to guard against inferior Japanese food outlets. In this class we will consider how Japanese food came to be defined in distinction to Western and Chinese foods beginning in the nineteenth century and how Japanese food became a global cuisine. Among our questions: What makes a dish Japanese? How did Portuguese or Spanish frying habits (tempura) and Chinese lamian (ramen) become hallmarks? How traditional is the diet of rice and fish and in what ways does it interact with the environment? How did Buddhist vegetarians justify sukiyaki? What relationship does food have to the longevity of Japanese today? How does gender affect Japanese food cultures? What are the origins of Iron Chef and bento?

STOCH SYS ANALYSIS SIMUL,null,41351,/courses/41351,Stochastic systems analysis and simulation (ESE 303) is a class that explores stochastic systems which we could loosely define as anything random that changes in time. Stochastic systems are at the core of a number of disciplines in engineering for example communication systems and machine learning. They also find application elsewhere including social systems markets molecular biology and epidemiology. The goal of the class is to learn how to model analyze and simulate stochastic systems. With respect to analysis we distinguish between what we could call theoretical and experimental analysis. By theoretical analysis we refer to a set of tools which let us discover and understand properties of the system. These analysis can only take us so far and is usually complemented with numerical analysis of experimental outcomes. Although we use the word experiment more often than not we simulate the stochastic system in a computer and analyze the outcomes of these virtual experiments.,[ESE-303],2.51,2.83,2.67,2.61,2.56,1.59,2.83,84

MATH OF MED IMAG&MEASURE,null,38898,/courses/38898,In the last 25 years there has been a revolution in image reconstruction techniques in fields from astrophysics to electron microscopy and most notably in medical imaging. In each of these fields one would like to have a precise picture of a 2 or 3 dimensional object which cannot be obtained directly.The data which is accesible is typically some collection of averages. The problem of image reconstruction is to build an object out of the averaged data and then estimate how close the reconstruction is to the actual object. In this course we introduce the mathematical techniques used to model measurements and reconstruct images. As a simple representative case we study transmission X-ray tomography (CT).In this context we cover the basic principles of mathematical analysis the Fourier transform interpolation and approximation of functions sampling theory digital filtering and noise analysis.,[MATH-584 -- BE-584],2.0,2.23,3.8,-1.0,3.6,-1.0,-1.0,13

RELIGION AND VIOLENCE,null,43441,/courses/43441,Perhaps nothing haunts modern politics more than religious violence. Killing sprees done in the name of God reveal the limits of political power. What spaceis left for the rule of law when appeals to dogma and the divine supersede reason? The causes and nature of divinely motivated violence are so mystifying that they are a constant topic of debate among academics political parties and news commentators. What really motivates religious violence? Is it just economic of class grievances in disguise? Are all religions prone to violence? Are some religions more violent than others? Or are religions only violent when they go awry denying their true messages? And does religion need to be quarantined and privatized to keep us all safe? In this course we'll probe the dividing line separating religion from politics in an effort to better understand the causes and nature of religious violence.

EMOTION & POWER,null,44886,/courses/44886,Is power smart? Conventional models of power-- both in everyday commonsense understandings and in academic studies-- tend to be instrumentalist. They understand power as a thoughtful exercise designed to achieve particular ends. But as we consider the political-cultural landscape does the assumption that power is rational hold up? This seminar will bring together an in-depth exploration of Michel Foucault's theory of power with contemporary affect theory to address this question. We will begin by mapping out Foucault's analytics of power from his early work on power knowledge to his late work on embodiment desire and the care of the self. We will then consider a series of interpretations of Foucault within contemporary affect theory an approach which centralizes the non-rational emotive force of power. Along the way we will consider formations of sex race religion material culture and cinema. No previous knowledge of theory is required. Students will be encouraged to connect the theoretical frames of the class to their own fields and areas of interest.,[RELS-552],4.0,4.0,3.0,-1.0,3.0,-1.0,-1.0,6

THE POLITICS OF SHINTO,null,44883,/courses/44883,Shinto-derived images and ideas frequently appear in Japanese anime and film and journalists and academics frequently mobilize the term Shinto as a way of explaining Japan's past or envisioning its future.

While the influential position Shinto occupies in Japanese sociopolitical life is therefore clear the term Shinto itself is actually not. Depending on who one asks Shinto is either the venerable indigenous religion of the Japanese archipelago the irreducible core of Japanese culture a tiny subset of Japanese Buddhism an environmentalist ethic or some combination of these.

POWER & PERIL: THE PARADOX OF MONARCHY AMONG ANCIENT GREEKS ROMANS & JEWS,null,42315,/courses/42315,We imagine Ancient Greece and Rome as the cradles of democracy and republicanism the early Judea as pious theocracy but the evidence tells us that monarchy was the most common and prevalent form of government in antiquity (and the premodern world in general). Despite their ubiquity the King was a polarizing figurein reality and in conception. On the one hand some idealized the monarchy as the ideal leader and monarchy provided the language with which to describe and even imagine the very godsbut on the other monarchs were widely reviled in both theory and practice from the Greek tyrant to biblical Saul. The Emperor Augustus loudly denied his own affinity to the office of king even as he ruled alone and was revered as a god. In other words kings stood both for the ideal ruler and the worst form of government. This class confronts the paradox of the King.,[ANCH-303 -- CLST-338 -- RELS-303 -- JWST-303],2.91,3.64,2.63,-1.0,2.63,-1.0,-1.0,12

Music & the Brain,null,43790,/courses/43790,Every human culture that has ever been described makes some form of music. The musics of different cultures cover a wide range of styles but also display fascinating similarities and a number of features are shared by even the most disparate musical traditions. Within our own culture music is inescapable-there are very few individuals who do not listen to some form of music every day and far more who listen to music virtually all day long. Appreciation of music comes very early: newborns prefer music to normal speech and mothers all over the world sing to their babies in a fundamentally similar way. And yet despite this seeming ubiquity the real origin and purpose of music remains unknown. Music is obviously related to language but how? Why do so many cultures make music in such fundamentally similar ways? What goes into the formation of music taste and preferences? Does music have survival value or is it merely auditory cheesecake a superfluous byproduct of evolution as some critics have maintained? What is the nature of musical ability and how do musicians differ from non-musicians?,[BIBB-060],2.93,3.27,1.8,-1.0,1.6,-1.0,-1.0,15

KOREAN POPULAR CULTURE,null,38394,/courses/38394,Korean Wave (Hallyu) a Korean popular culture phenomenon is currently raging throughout Asia and is making its way to the West(maybe?) From Korean tele-dramas and K-pop music to their respective celebrity icons these popular cultural forms from Korea are increasingly becoming part of the everyday landscape and vocabulary. We will attempt to understand and evaluate this cultural phenomenon--its promises and limitations as well as its popularity and backlash against it. More specifically this course explores the ways in which television music manhwa (comic books) and the internet participate in the transnational production and circulation of culture modernity tradition ideology and politics. One of the central topics that the spring 2007 course will consider is the curious ways in which popular culture repeatedly restages (or translates) Korea's past in order to comment on its present. For example we will study television dramas such as The Immortal Yi Sunsin (Korea-Japan relations) Chumong (Reclamation of northeastern China as part of ancient Korea) and Goong (Imagining Korea as a constitutional monarchy with its royal family). In addition to these primary texts we will read theoretical and critical writings on mass culture new media narratology and translation.,[EALC-198 -- EALC-598],2.21,2.14,2.42,-1.0,2.58,-1.0,-1.0,15

Class-members jointly explore the many ways in which cultural research traditional arts and community studies are brought to public audiences. In particular we will discuss how modern public scholars can work to reconcile the ideas and ideals so often discussed in the academy which practice in the community. Our class will engage in critical assessment of both cultural and programming and civically engaged scholarship with an eye toward developing a more politically aware practice and more collaborative community-sensitive models for action.,[FOLK-579],3.4,3.6,3.2,-1.0,3.0,-1.0,-1.0,5

READING ANC MESOPOTAMIA,null,44611,/courses/44611,An introduction to the literature of Ancient Mesopotamia. The literature of ancient Mesopotamia flourished thousands of years ago in a culture all of its own yet the survival of hundreds of thousands of written records challenges us to read it and make sense of it without simply approximating it to the realm of our own understanding. How can we learn to do this? Situating our understanding of how we read and how we understand culture within an interdisciplinary range of literary-critical and analytic approaches we will approach this question by immersing ourselves in the myths tales and mentalities that made Mesopotamian literature meaningful. To give us a measure of our progress we will bracket the semester by reading Gilgamesh which is never less than a great story but which will take on new layers of meaning as the semester develops and we learn to read the text in more and more Mesopotamian ways. As we journey through these mysterious realms we will reflect not only Mesopotamia and its immortal literature but on what it means to read and understand any cultures other than our own.,[NELC-244 -- NELC-544],3.5,3.7,1.75,-1.0,1.75,-1.0,-1.0,10

MOD HEB LIT & CULT TRANS:   MODERN HEBREW LITERATURE & CULTURE IN TRANSLATION:HOLOCAUST IN LIT & FILM,null,40397,/courses/40397,Fall 2016: In the first decade of the new millennium the so called Second Generation children of Holocaust survivors reached maturity.

These include striking narratives Our Holocaust by Amir Gutfreund and Corner People by Esty G. Hayim as well as films like Walk on Water. The third generation is also returning to the forbidden story with prize winning films like The apartment. The quintessential Holocaust narrative The Diary of Anne Frank appeared in 1947 one year prior to the establishment of the Jewish State. Nevertheless Israeli culture waited until the public trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961 to hesitantly face the momentous catastrophe. The Zionist wish to forge a New Jew motivated this suppression at least in part. Aharon Appelfeld's stories were the first Holocaust-related works to enter the modernist literary scene in the 1960s followed by the cryptic verse of Dan Pagis a fellow child survivor. It was not until 1988 that this practice of concealing the past was broken when two Israeli-born pop singers children of survivors released the watershed documentary Because of That War.,[NELC-159 -- CINE-159 -- JWST-154 -- COML-282 -- ENGL-079],3.75,3.79,2.0,-1.0,2.56,-1.0,-1.0,28

We then discuss the ways in which elite rhetoric and the media move public opinion including through the use of public opinion polls. Finally we ask whether policymakers are actually sensitive to the voice of the people or only the voice of some of the people.,[COMM-431],1.92,2.15,1.5,2.7,1.8,1.5,2.3,15
MILITARY MEDICINE & TECH,null,42977,/courses/42977,War and its effects on the human body are brutal; the carnage of the battlefield and the conditions of camp life have presented special challenges to medicine throughout history. People and governments have sought to quell carnage and deter war through the development of ever-more-lethal technologies though in the end they mostly created more spectacular ways of maiming flesh. But the significance of medicine and technology in a military context extends well beyond the injuries and illnesses of war. Looking more closely at the ways in which engineers physicians inventors military officers soldiers and civilians have interacted with each other both in war and in peace reveals much about the political cultural and disciplinary formation of military medicine and technology in the modern era. This seminar surveys the history of medicine technology nursing innovation and public health as they are conducted in a military context exploring the ways in which the practices theories tools and imagined needs of the military have played and continue to play a prominent role in conceptualizations of warfare morality the body and ethics.,[HSOC-454 -- STSC-454],3.0,3.1,2.23,-1.0,2.31,-1.0,-1.0,20

This course explores and critically evaluates those arguments. Key questions include: how if at all have Americans political attitudes and ideologie s changed? How have their connections to politics changed? What has this meant for the fortunes and strategies of the two parties? How have the parties base voters and swing voters changed? What changes in American society have advantaged some political messages and parties at the expense of others? Focusing primarily on mass-level politics we consider a wide range of potential causes including the role of race in American politics suburbanization economic transformations the evolving constellation and structure of interest groups declining social capital the changing role of religion immigration and the actions of parties and political elites. For three weeks in the semester we will take a break from considering broader trends to look at specific elections in some depth.,[PSCI-234],3.08,3.28,2.67,-1.0,2.7,-1.0,-1.0,39

According to the OECD by the end of the century close to 85% of the projected population will live in cities. The transition towards an urban planet is likely to have far-reaching economic environmental social political and cultural impacts on our species many of which we cannot yet predict. But what is urbanization? Will it it lead to more inequality exploitation conflict resource consumption and exposure to natural disasters and climate change or is it an opportunity to move the world in a more sustainable and equitable direction? This course aims to explore these questions.,[URBS-457 -- SOCI-435],2.64,2.93,2.62,-1.0,3.17,-1.0,-1.0,15

Statistical Reasoning for Behavioral Science,null,43762,/courses/43762,For permits please see: https://www.sas.upenn.edu/lps/graduate/mbds/permit-request The complexity of human behavior exceeds that of most phenomena studied in the natural sciences. Any inference about human behavior and decision-making has to rely on statistical methods (rather than on deterministic modeling). In this class we will learn the methods of descriptive and inferential statistics commonly used in behavioral science starting from the very basics and advancing to most commonly used. In this sense this is a class on theoretical statistics. We will go beyond theory though and learn to apply these methods to answer our own research questions. As such this is also a class on applied statistics. Wewill rely heavily on statistical programming languages (namely R) and version control systems (Git) to create statistical reports. This class will thus have an element of programming. Finally we will work with new research inthe field and learn to critically assess the statistical methods used therein. Statistics are a powerful tool but they can be misused. Ronald Coase once said If you torture the data enough nature will always confess. Responsible researchers do not engage in torture but many you will encounter ddo. In this sense this is a class about lying with data. After completing,[BDS-522],3.37,3.45,3.0,-1.0,3.53,-1.0,-1.0,21

It will focus on one of the questions that has vexed the field from the beginning: Why are the Digital Humanities So White? as Tara McPherson put it rather bluntly in a chapter of Debates in the Digital Humanities. The class will provide an overview of some of the foundational texts of DH but the primary focus of the class will be involving students in a new DH project to construct an interactive timeline built in Omeka. The spatio-temporal timeline seeks to represent Iroquois history as seen from the perspective of Iroquois scholar and Faithkeeper Richard Hill. Hill is the director of the Deyohahage: Indigenous Knowledge Centre on the Six Nations reserve in the Grand River region of Ontario and one of the most highly regarded traditional knowledge keepers of his generation so it is a great honor to be able to work with him.,[RELS-446 -- HIST-446],3.5,4.0,3.0,-1.0,3.5,-1.0,-1.0,2
MODELS FOR MKTG STRATEGY,null,41772,/courses/41772,In today's business environment marketing executives are involved in complex decision-making and they become responsible for return on their marketing investments. The first objective of this course is to help participants become better executives. By exposing students to various analytical and computer-based tools developed for solving marketing problems it will help to prepare them for careers in industries such as consumer packaged goods hi-tech financial services media and entertainment pharmaceutical consulting and venture capital. The course's main focus is on various existing models such as models that predict the consumer's dynamic adoption of an innovative product. However at some point in their career students may find themselves facing business problems for which a model can assist in making decisions but no existing model is available. Hence the second objective of the course is to provide participants with critical skills necessary to evaluate new models to which they may be exposed by attending presentations or reading the literature. The models to be discussed in the class have been implemented and proven useful in a wide range of industries (e.g. business-to-consumers and business-to-business).,[MKTG-771 -- MKTG-271],1.79,1.87,2.37,2.18,2.46,1.39,2.14,40

QUANT MODEL:DEC/SOC SCI,null,40991,/courses/40991,How is a forest fire relevant to bank failures? What can an urn tell us about constitutional change? In this course we will learn about and apply many different models to a broad range of social science phenomena. Social science problems often have so many details and moving parts that it can be difficult for researchers to gain traction. By using models we can think abstractly about the core mechanics of a problem - like Brexit sharing articles on socialmedia or water conservation - and generate expectations for outcomes. This is aclass that moves quickly and covers a lot of ground. Each class we'll discuss adifferent model and its application to social science looking at how we can apply the model's insights to existing and ongoing questions in social science.This is also a class that involves a fair bit of writing - to be a successful social scientist you will need to not only have interesting ideas but you willneed to convey those ideas to others effectively.

Into The Fire: Religious Sacrifice in Comparative Perspective,null,43440,/courses/43440,Sacrifice or the presentation of sacred offerings to the gods is one of the most common activities in all religious traditions. The presence of sacrifice throughout history and across cultures has led many scholars to suggest that this type of ritual encapsulates the essence of religious behavior. Understanding sacrifice is thus an important factor of understanding religion and any explanation of sacrifice is a theory of religion in miniature. This class will introduce students to influential anthropological sociological and psychological theories of sacrifice from early depictions of sacrifice as an act of commercial exchange between humans and superhuman agents to more recent theories that stress the role of sacrifice as a political device for augmenting power relations within society. We will test these theories by applying them to several case studies derived from Asian religions such as the Indian Yajna fire ritual the Chinese ancestral sacrifice and the self-sacrifice of the Bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism. Our study of both theory and practice will help us better understand the persistent presence of sacrifice from antiquity to the modern day.,[RELS-016],3.36,3.5,1.0,-1.0,1.2,-1.0,-1.0,22

BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS,null,43781,/courses/43781,Behavioral economics applies insights from psychology to the study of economic phenomena. This course will take the possibility of deviations from rational self-interested behavior as a starting point and explore two main questions: How does psychology play out in markets where sophisticated and unsophisticated consumers and firms interact and compete? And what does behavioral economics imply for public policy? Markets have the potential to protect consumers from their biases when firms compete to give biased consumers the best deal. In addition markets allow for the emergence of informational intermediaries that give biased consumers advice. We will examine whether and how this remedy is provided in a diverse array of markets. Behavioral economics also affects what governments should do and what governments actually do when they address market failures combat poverty and inequality and raise revenue. This course therefore also explores Behavioral Public Finance -- optimal policy in the presence of biases -- and Behavioral Political Economy -- how biases affect the choices of politicians and regulators themselves.,[BEPP-220],2.48,2.78,3.24,2.76,1.95,2.29,2.81,26

AUGUSTAN CULTRL REVOL,null,42563,/courses/42563,The career of the man who was born Gaius Octavius and who died as the Emperor Augustus spanned the death of the Roman Republic a protracted period of shared dictatorship and intermittent civil war. It ended with the concentration of power in the hands of one man and the foundation of a long-lasting hereditary monarchy. Over the course of this career Octavius/Augustus transformed himself several times and oversaw the metamorphosis of the Roman state. Increasingly historians have come to focus not only on the military political legal and administrative reforms that made this transformation possible but on the revolutionary cultural changes that supported measures and made the new order acceptable to Romans at different levels of society.

Can a sport really be a religion? This course will teach students how to think about sports as ritual that brings people together divides them and gives athletes the power to remake themselves through the way they use and talk about their bodies. We will first look at the ceremonial and ritual aspects of sports from the view of the spectator or fan considering the question of whether sports teams are totems-- symbols of greater entities that communities gather around for identity and unity. Then we will look at the ritual aspect of sport from the viewpoint of the athlete considering the ways that athletes use their bodies in sports to foster community and even spirituality. There will be a secondary focus on raising ethical questions through a discussion of case studies based on real events. Issues of religion race ethnicity gender age and disability will be prominently featured. There will be guest speakers- athletic and academic and at least one class visit to a sporting event.

Our historical survey will follow three intertwined threads. We will examine physical color theories nanely what various writers thought color was in things themselves and how color was related to light. We will study anatomical and physiological accounts of the eye especially the way in which ocular anatomy was intimately tied to ideas about color. And we will trace the history of color technology namely how people in the past have struggled to bring color under control. As a part of this we will study the long history of alchemy which was in a sense born out of attempts to mimic precious stones and metals - especially their color - and we will touch on the closely related histories of dyeing pigments and painting. When possible we will reproduce notable historical anatomies particularly the anatomical procedures of Galen Vesalius and others and we will also replicate some key historical experiences and experiments concerning color.,[VLST-215 -- STSC-315],3.2,3.2,2.4,-1.0,2.6,-1.0,-1.0,5

South Korea in the Global Economy: Present and Future,null,35581,/courses/35581,This course examines policy challenges and possible national strategies for South Korea ( Korea hereafter) if it were to join the ranks of the most advanced economies in the world. Korea has achieved a remarkable economic success during the past half a century. Dubbed the Miracle on the Han River Korea is the first country in the world to successfully transition from an aid recipient to a donor country thanks to condensed growth strategy. While its success has far surpassed the average growth performances of most developing economies during the past decades Korea is still categorized as an emerging economy. An advanced economy arguably has various defining characteristics such as (1) flexible institutions in line with global norms; (2) policies less prone to crisis; (3) resilient economic system capable of overcoming and dealing with crisis; (4) contributions to global prosperity through active participation in development assistance and global economic cooperation; and (5) respect for universal value by economic agents. From this perspective we will consider major challenges for Korea including (1) increasing potential output; (2) institutional reform in compliance with global norms; (3) active contribution to global economic cooperation; and (4) preparation for reunification.,[EALC-193 -- PSCI-228 -- ECON-028],2.93,3.21,2.27,-1.0,2.09,-1.0,-1.0,14

ANCIENT SKEPTICISM,null,36341,/courses/36341,A study of some major texts in Ancient Greek Scepticsm. We will begin with Plato's Academy more than a century after the death of its founder when the head of the school Arcesilaus (315-240 BCE) advocates a turn away from doctrinal Platonism (that is working out and defending the tenets of Plato's philosophy) and a return to the critical stance of Socrates in many Platonic dialogues who advances no doctrines himself but criticizes the claims of others. Much of the intellectural activity of the so-called Sceptical Academy is directed at contesting the doctrines of their contemporaries in Hellenistic Athens: Stoic Epicurean and Peripatetic philosophers with particular emphasis on the Stoic doctrine of the cognitive impression which the Stoics invoked as the foundation of all knowledge. Many of these debates are reported in Cicero's On Academic Scepticism which is the first text we will study. By the late first century BCE the Academy departed far enough from this skeptical stance that in reaction the Academic Aenesidemus left that institution to found Pyrrhonism which takes the fourth-century figure Pyrrho of Elis (360-270 BCE) as its symbolic figure head. The fullest account of Pyrrhonist Scepticism is in the writings of a 2nd century CE physician Sextus Empirucus whose Outlines of Pyrrhonism and,[PHIL-536],3.8,3.8,3.2,-1.0,3.4,-1.0,-1.0,5

The course will be an investigation of several different strains of this rationalist idea. We'll disucss four rationalist views of the nature of normative reasons (Kantian Humean Aristotelian and new-fangled constructivism). Our aim will be to investigate the plausibility of these rationalist views against the backdrop of a more recent hypothesis about the metaphysics of the normative--viz. the claim that normative reasons themselves are the fundamental constituents of the normative.,[PHIL-572],3.8,3.8,3.2,-1.0,3.0,-1.0,-1.0,5

Islam and the Religious Image,null,36466,/courses/36466,This seminar explores the place of visual religious arts in Islam; we will attempt to get beyond conventional ideas regarding the im/propriety of visual representation to examine how Muslims have understood and deployed visual art in a number of historical and cultural contexts. In the process we will explore the ways in which visuality as a process renders the act of seeing into a religious experieence. As such we will also examine the role of the arts in relation to religion: how does vision affect the understanding and practice of religion and what do visual arts tell us about religion in ways that texts of speech cannot? Simultaneously what does the study of religion tell us about visual art that art history cannot?,[RELS-541 -- NELC-581 -- SAST-541],3.33,3.67,2.88,-1.0,3.13,-1.0,-1.0,9

MLA Proseminar: Justice and Culture,null,37759,/courses/37759,This course examines the special problems culture and cultural membership pose for the liberal conception of justice. Liberal justice is supposedly impartial while cultural claims are thought to be partial and particular. And whereas liberal justice is concerned primarily with the individual cultural claims are commonly thought to be group-based. How are these conflicting values to be understood? We will examine the problem of culture and justice as it arises in the domestic context (e.g. in the context of the liberal state) and in the global context. Some of the more specific questions we will examine include: Should our conception of justice be influenced by cultureal claims? Should cultural differences shape our understanding of human rights? Or should justice transcend culture? What is the relationship between individual freedom and cultural membership? Are there or should there be such things as cultural rights? If cultural diversity ought to be tolerated and even celebrated what are the limits of cultural toleration? Is nationalism justifiable? Authors we will read include John Rawls Charles Taylor Amy Gutmann Will Kymlicka Martha Nussbaum and Susan Moller Okin.

TOPICS IN AESTHETICS,null,37749,/courses/37749,What is beauty? What is the relationship between beauty and goodness? What does aesthetic judgment tell us if anything about the world? This course addresses these and other questions by focusing predominantly on Kant's highly influential aesthetic theory. It situates this text in the context of other works on aesthetics. We begin with Plato's view expressed in The Symposium that beauty is a form to which humans gain (some) access through love. We then turn to essays by Shaftesbury and Hume that introduce key aesthetic notions that Kant will elaborate (and revise) -- including those of taste common sense harmony and aesthetic disinterest. We also read selections from the work of Friedrich Schiller John Dewey and A. K. Coomaraswamy who offer alternative accounts of the relationship between beauty and ethical life -- a relationship that Kant acknowledges but considers to be importantly limited. The question of the relationship between ethics and aesthetics will form the backdrop for this semester's reading overall.,[PHIL-280 -- GRMN-280],3.7,3.9,2.67,-1.0,2.67,-1.0,-1.0,10

ASP-Managing Fixed Income Portfolios,null,38625,/courses/38625,The goal of this course is to teach you how to manage a real portfolio of Treasury sovereign corporate and mortgage bonds. We develop three basic models for the Treasury yield curve corporate and sovereign credit spreads and use these models to find value in the bond market. To implement the concepts learned in class students form teams to manage a paper portfolio using Barclays Point a state-of-the-art portfolio management system. Your team trades a $1 billion portfolio of bonds for which your goal will be to outperform the Barclays Aggregate Index. You trade real securities at real prices - only the money is fake. We begin by relating the term structure of interest rates to the market's view of the fundamental macroeconomic states of growth unemployment and inflation. To do this we need to understand a multifactor term structure model which extends the Vasicek model you studied in the prerequisite course. Any bond other than a Treasury has an embedded option either to default prepay or in some other way reduce the promised payments to bondholders. Robert Merton was the first to recognize explicitly that any corporate bond can be evaluated by calculating the value of the default option. Merton's model and its extensions are currently the state of the art models used in asset management firms for valuing bonds.,[FNCE-894 -- FNCE-394],3.4,3.7,3.38,3.63,2.75,1.25,3.25,10

PHIL & VISUAL PERCEPTION: Hallucinations Illusions and Knowledge,null,39434,/courses/39434,It seems at first glance that vision puts us into direct contact with reality. At the same time we know that at least some of our visual experiences are illusory or hallucinatory. Such cases are in fact quite widespread in our ordinary lives (as we will see in this course). In these cases however vision almost always fails to match reality. Given this how can we trust vision? Does it give us direct contact to reality or are our visual experiences instead more like a veil between us and the real world? In this course we will explore different philosophical theories of perception that try to make sense of what vision is in a way that also accounts for illusions and hallucinations. To better understand and evaluate these theories we will spend some time exploring different kinds of illusions and hallucinations in detail. Towards the end of the course we will turn to successful cases of vision. In particular we will focus on cases of visual expertise where experts train their visual systems in ways that better yield knowledge in a particular domain. Some readings for the course will be posted on Canvas while others will be drawn from the required course reader Philosophy of Perception: A Contemporary Introduction by William Fish.,[VLST-223 -- PHIL-223],3.06,3.17,2.07,-1.0,1.79,-1.0,-1.0,18

PHIL & COGNITIVE SCIENCE,null,36329,/courses/36329,Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind with modern roots that can be traced to the 1930s and 1940s. Philosophers have been studying the mind for thousands of years but the scientific findings resulting from cognitive science provide new opportunities to revise and adjudicate between theories. Across the disciplines of cognitive science it is widely agreed that the mind like the turtle's shell or the bird's wings is the product of evolution. But evolution seldom plays a central role in the development of theories about particular aspects of the mind. How can thinking about evolution help us reconcile theory with the results of key disciplines in cognitive science like psychology and the neurosciences? We'll take up this question by exploring the relationship between theory and experimental evidence in four core areas of cognitive science: perception memory rationality and morality. Students will be required to write two short essays and one exam.,[PHIL-032],3.38,3.38,2.13,-1.0,2.38,-1.0,-1.0,10

How is it possible to come to know something we did not know already--and how can we aid others in doing that? How if at all should formal institutions of education be concerned with shaping students' moral and civic character? What is the proper relation between educational institutions and the state? We also ask questions more specific to our own time and context. For example: how in a multicultural state should we educate students of varied social identities like race gender and religion? What is the relationship between education and justice.,[PHIL-249],3.6,3.6,2.0,-1.0,2.25,-1.0,-1.0,6
NATIONS NATIONALISM & POLITICS,null,38092,/courses/38092,This course explores historical and ethnographic approaches to the diverse forms of nations and nationalism in the world. Course discussions will begin by examining how capitalism contributed to the formation of a nationalist bourgeois class and how this historical class took a key role in creating the concepts of nation national territory and unified national market. We will investigate how people and local communities reacted to the changes caused by these spreading ideas. By reading about the various forms and idea of nation and nationalism students can understand how the unique conditions of a specific locale have affected their formation sometimes with destructiv consequences examining cases both from the West and the rest. In the case of the West we will firstly look into the constructive role of bourgeois class during the French Revolution and how they created the ideal form of a nation which has clearly divided national territories a national language and a national education system army and most of all a unified national market. Later we will discuss how the image of the ideal nation has been transferred to other places and transformed according to the specific local situations.,[ANTH-202],4.0,4.0,3.0,-1.0,3.0,-1.0,-1.0,3

Over the course of roughly a hundred years Europeans have shaped the fates of peoples living beyond the western world for instance through the impact of two world wars European colonialism and the global Cold War. At the same time European societies 'at home' were not left unaffected by these interactions. Even today Europeans are facing the legacies of some of these histories in immigration and the politics of religion and secularism for example.

MARTIANS IN NEW JERSEY: MEDIA PERFORMANCE AND AMERICA IN 1938,null,42953,/courses/42953,In the most famous of Halloween pranks in 1938 Orson Welles broadcast the annihilation of the world and in doing so blurred the bounds between fiction and reality. Told through a series of newscasts the program The War of the Worlds led many to believe that martians had indeed attacked the United States. Aired as radio was becoming a leading source of entertainment and news this radio play would become one of the new medium's most recalled and most controversial programs. In this course we use the story of Welles's play to open a window into the United States in the Great Depression and on the eve of World War II. That story will help us consider America's early engagement with radio and the mass media the possibilities for storytelling on the air and the connections between media and manipulation. To explore such topics in depth performance will be a key component of the course: Students will develop and deliver a broadcast of the play through which we will consider radio theater and the world of War of the Worlds.,[HIST-247 -- THAR-275],2.8,2.8,2.67,-1.0,3.22,-1.0,-1.0,10

HUMAN RIGHTS AND HISTORY,null,44337,/courses/44337,The idea of universal inalienable rights--once dismissed by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham as nonsense upon stilts--has become the dominant moral language of our time the self-evident truth par excellence of our age. Human rights have become a source of inspiration to oppressed individuals and groups across the world the rallying cry for a global civil society and not least a controversial source of legitimation for American foreign policy. This seminar asks: how did all this come to be? We will investigate human rights not only as theories embodied in texts but as practices embedded in specific historical contexts. Are human rights the product of a peculiarly European heritage of the Enlightenment and protestantism? How did Americans reconcile inalienable rights with the reality of slavery? Did human rights serve as a civilizing mask for colonialism? Can universal rights be reconciled with genuine cultural diversity? Through case studies and close readings the seminar will work toward a genealogy of human rights.,[HIST-414],2.91,3.36,3.14,-1.0,3.71,-1.0,-1.0,11

SHARED CULTURE: NEW STRATEGIES FOR ARTISTS IN THE DIGITAL AGE,null,35767,/courses/35767,Our digital world has forced us to entirely rethink what it means to be an artist in the digital age socially economically and politically. Ideas that have long been stable - including originality creativity and genius - are ripe for reexamination and redefinition in the twenty- first century. When the entire internet is copy- and-pasteable - and distribution moves swiftly - is anything off limits for the artist? Can we imagine our artistic production mimicking the meme rippling through the networks for a day then disappearing forever? Are we doomed to make works that are supposed to live for eternity or in the face of environmental meltdown and collapsing financial markets can we instead move our production toward the ephemeral? What would this look like? Can our output be steered toward the political? Can we frame these ideas as acts of resistance? Or compliance? Is there an inside?

CONTEMPORARY PHIL: Beyond Biology:  Enhancing the human mind through technology,null,39149,/courses/39149,Transhumanists seek to extend the capacities of the human mind beyond the bounds of the human brain and body through technology. Indeed for them such an extension of human thinking and feeling represents the next big step in human cognitive evolution. In this course we will examine the philosophical conception of a mind that underpins this movement to extend the human mind beyond human biology. Through an examination of the hypothesis that there can be non-biological thinking and feeling we consider whether technologies that enable or enhance human mental faculties might one day completely supplant the biological machinery of the human body. We will also consider the moral issues surrounding the creation of transhumans. The questions that we consider in this course will get to the heart of what it means to possess a human mind and indeed to be a human being.,[PHIL-032],3.17,3.43,2.33,-1.0,2.17,-1.0,-1.0,7

SERVICE OPER MGMT,null,36312,/courses/36312,The service sector represents the largest segment of most industrial economies. In the U.S. for example it accounts for approximately 70% of GDP and 70% of employment. In addition to this pure service sector the operations and competitive positions of many manufacturing firms are becoming increasingly service-oriented. While operational excellence is critical for success in most industries today in a wide range of service industries this is particularly true. For example recent significant deregulation in banking health care and communications has led to intensified competition and pressure on operations. At the same time the rapid evolution of information technology has enabled firms to operate in a fashion - and offer a level of service - that has not been previously possible. Elements common to most services make the management of their operations complex however. In particular services are intangible not storable or transportable and often highly variable. Frequently their delivery involves distributed operations with a significant amount of customer contact. All of these factors make service opertions end up looking quite a bit different than manufacturing operations and the task of achieving excellence in them requires specialized analysis frameworks and tools.,[OPIM-658],2.66,2.73,2.91,2.7,2.43,1.79,2.94,44

MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS: Honors,null,35365,/courses/35365,Managerial economics is the application of microeconomic theory to managerial decision-making. Microeconomic theory is a remarkably useful body of ideas for understanding and analyzingt the behavior of individuals and firms in a variety of economic settingsd. The goal of the course is for you to understand this body of theory well enough so that you can effectively analyze managerial (and other) problems in an economic framework. While this is a tools course we will cover many business applications so taht you can witness the usefulness of thse tools and acquire the skills to use them yourself. We will depart from the usualy microeconomic thoery course by giving more emphasis to prescription: What should a manager do in order to achieve some objective? That course deliverable is to be cmpared with description: Why do firms and consumers act the way they do? The latter will still be quite prominent in this course because only by understanding how customers and competitors behave can a manager determine the best strategy. Turning to coverage the course begins with development of the theory of supply and demand underlying the competitive model. We then turn to monopoly and oligopoly and investigate the development and use of market power such s through price descrimination.,[BEPP-250 -- BEPP-950],2.32,2.5,2.94,2.76,2.33,1.61,2.81,40

Conflicts on the African continent are some of the least well understood by lay publics; often characterized as the result of pre-modern tribalism and a naturalized consequence of state dysfunction or resource scarcity. In this course we will demystify the notion that war is inevitable or that some cultures are naturally prone to conflict. We will do so by examining some of the underlying challenges to consensus and peace in cities and countries in Africa drawing connection to conditions both historic and contemporary that exist closer to home. After all-and as recent conflict conflict geographies such as the Dakota Access Pipeline Charlottesville Rally and Women's March remind us-spaces and communities in in the United States are rife with struggle and contestation. Throughout the semester we will ask: How do individuals experience conflict? What roles do spaces have in structuring oppression activating conflicts resisting power and building peace? How is the study of conflict-understood as both routine contestation and violent confrontation-informed by research on built and natural environments?

CULTURES OF SCIENCE&TECH,null,43696,/courses/43696,Science and technology figure centrally in the economic political and socio-cultural changes that impact our worlds. Happenings in the life sciences including the discovery of new genes pathways and processes are redrawing concepts of the body and human nature and refiguring social and political relations. The seminar starts from the premise that scientific facts are made not things existing a priori in the world and that are merely picked up by researchers and consumed by lay audiences. Likewise technologies are created through a process of intense negotiation between producers and their sophisticated users. Focusing on the biosciences we explore the production of science and technology and how they 1)affect individuals self-identities subjectivity kinship and social relationships; 2)have interacted with or reinforced political programs racial classifications unequal access to knowledge and patterns of social injustice; 3)inform contemporary institutional structures strategies of governance and practices of citizenship.

DISCOVER THE MIDDLE AGES,null,44313,/courses/44313,This course offers a broad introduction to the history of medieval Europe roughly from the fourth century CE when Roman civilization faced a series of crises that led to its eventual fall in the West and ushered in the Middle Ages to the sixteenth century when European society entered a new early-modern phase. As this is a long period we will focus on themes that will help us explore some of the most important historical problems related to the period: why was it that a sophisticated and militarily superior Roman empire could fall to barbarians? How did political power transform into a feudal model? What did it mean to be a medeival knight? The Middle Ages are known as an age of faith but at the same time it was an age of questioning that invented the modern university--what roles did faith and knowledge play in the medieval world? It was also a time where many cultures races and religions came into contact both at home and in efforts at exploration and conquest. How did medieval culture handle difference and how did that influence early-modern and even modern approaches? The class will involve a mixture of lecture and discussion and will include visits to local museum and manuscript collections to provide students first-hand contact with the visual and material culture of medieval Europe.,[HIST-145],2.86,3.29,2.29,-1.0,2.43,-1.0,-1.0,8

IMPORTED FUTURES:,null,40743,/courses/40743,How have countries deemed outside the economic political and geographic centers of the modern world made use of science and technology? And how have scientists in imperial centers typically depicted those in so-called peripheries? Countries beyond North America and Western Europe have typically been absent from conventional historical and sociological analyses of modern science and technology. If depicted it is often as outlying sites where Northern scientists extract data or as primitive societies whose transition to the modern world will be sped up through imported knowledge and techniques. During the Cold War era social scientists believed the future prosperity of countries in the Third World to depend on their adoption of technical knowledge from the First World. This seminar seeks to unsettle these kinds of narratives. Focusing primarily on Latin America and also considering sub-Saharan Africa Southeast Asia and Australasia this seminar will examine how the Global South has been a rich site of scientific creativity and technological invention. By studying the creation of scientific knowledge in the Global South this seminar dissolves conventional dichotomies - such as primitive/modern core/periphery developed/ underdeveloped - and examines the role of technoscience in the formation of global asymmetries.,[STSC-018],0.25,0.5,2.5,-1.0,2.25,-1.0,-1.0,4

CITY & CITIZENSHIP/JAPAN,null,41222,/courses/41222,In the early modern period (1600-1867) Japan underwent a staggering urban transformation.

Indeed most of Japan's current urban centers descend directly from the castle towns built by regional warlords in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries in an effort keep the peace after over a hundred years of civil war. As a result Japanese cities in the early modern period became a central component of what historians have called a re-feudalization of society and retained strong vestiges of their military origins. At the same time the samurai-centered space of the new cities created opportunities for the development of alternative cultural practices and values by urban commoners. The juxtaposition of the regimented honor-driven society designed and longed for by samurai and the fluid money-driven society that grew out of the burgeoning cities' commoner quarters is one of the animating forces of the early modern period. Through study of scholarship and contemporary sources (laws and sumptuary regulations codes of conducts but also diaries novels plays) this course will explore the many facets of early modern urban society its medieval antecedents and its legacies in contemporary Japan.,[EALC-162 -- EALC-562],4.0,4.0,3.0,-1.0,3.33,-1.0,-1.0,6

CULTURES OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,null,35288,/courses/35288,Science and technology figure centrally in the economic political and socio-cultural changes that impact our worlds. Happenings in the life sciences including the discovery of new genes pathways and processes are redrawing concepts of the body and human nature and refiguring social and political relations. The seminar starts from the premise that scientific facts are made not things existing a priori in the world and that are merely picked up by researchers and consumed by lay audiences. Likewise technologies are created through a process of intense negotiation between producers and their sophisticated users. Focusing on the biosciences we explore the production of science and technology and how they 1)affect individuals self-identities subjectivity kinship and social relationships; 2)have interacted with or reinforced political programs racial classifications unequal access to knowledge and patterns of social injustice; 3)inform contemporary institutional structures strategies of governance and practices of citizenship.

As the catastrophic human disasters in Houston Florida and Puerto Rico have recently shown these relations are today everywhere being unsettled and exacerbated by climate change. In cities as diverse as Philadelphia and Mumbai climate change promises to exacerbate social inequalities and further squeeze non-human natures. How is the urban environment produced magnified divided and shrunk with water? In these times how might we make space for social justice and non-human natures in and along rising urban waters?,[ANTH-297],3.88,3.88,2.33,-1.0,2.67,-1.0,-1.0,8
DEATH DISEASE & DEMONS,null,42077,/courses/42077,How did life end for people in the medieval world? For most death was not considered an end point because the soul journeyed on after the end of the body. But to where did it journey? And how would it be re-united with the body in the future? Between the classical period and the High Middle Ages death shifted from a moment of quiet release to a frightening struggle in which angels and demons lay in wait for a soul as soon as it exited the body. This course will examine these changing beleifs about dying focusing primarily on Christian medieval Europe but drawing comparative examples from Judaism the Roman world and Byzantine Christianity. Other topics we'll consider include martyrdom and fears of bodily dismemberment; the emergence of purgatory and depictions of the afterworld; and the development of Christian rites for the dead. We'll also investigate beliefs about the invisible powers of demons and the apocalyptic end of times. The course will also explore not only the process by which people entered the afterlife in the Middle Ages but also the causes of their deaths-- what kinds of disease primarily afflicted medieval society and how did age class and gender intersect with disease to affect certain populations? We will end the semester by examining that most apocalyptic of Medieval events-- the Black,[RELS-239],3.6,4.0,2.83,-1.0,3.0,-1.0,-1.0,6

TOPICS IN HIST OF PHIL: Topics in Early Modern Philosophy,null,40541,/courses/40541,Today Friedrich Schiller is primarily known for his dramas and poems. However during a period of several years (after he was appointed professor of History in Jena) he was also concerned with philosophical issues. The focus was mainly on questions of aesthetics and philosophy of history. With regard to both it was Kant who was extremely influential for the development of Schiller's philosophical position. But Schiller did not simply copy or rearrange Kantian ideas in fact he evolved Kantian philosophy significantly in numerous respects. And even though Schiller later gave up with his philosophical ambitions--in a letter he even dismissed his philosophical efforts altogether as immature--his specific understanding of Kantian philosophy became extremely iknfluential for the genesis of German idalism in general but in particular shaped the reception of Kantian ideas by Hegel. In this seminar we will look at Schiller's most important philosophical writings and address both his conception of aesthetics and his approach to philosophy of history. The seminar and discussion are in English.,[PHIL-467 -- GRMN-567],3.5,3.83,2.4,-1.0,2.2,-1.0,-1.0,7

Although negotiations are a ubiquitous part ofour everyday lives many of us know little about the strategy and psychology ofeffective negotiations. Why do we sometimes get our way while other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement we desire?

Public Financial Leadership in the New Fiscal Reality,null,42864,/courses/42864,Several factors are intersecting upon U.S. local governments including: muted economic growth demographics technological change ineffective monetary & fiscal policy and political shenanigans. These are having a profound impact on local government financial health. Many local governments are struggling to structurally balance their budgets even now several years into one of the longest U.S. post-WWII economic recoveries. Expenditure demand especially because of rising employee pension and OPEB benefits is rising faster than expected. Revenues are not rising as quickly as they have historically. This New Fiscal Reality is redefining the concept of municipal distress. Further the options local governments have to respond to distress may be changing. It might be necessary for local governments to move away from typical solutions like distressed municipality programs and other state level aid. If the current financial trajectory continues some local governments will not be able to deliver the same service-level they have in the past.

Innovations in financial markets are rapidly imitated because even complex contracts and strategies that use existing securities or they are seen as equivalent to dynamically-adjusted positions in other securities. A strong foundation in the technical tools and statistical methods is invaluable in this process of financial engineering. The objectives in this course are two fold. First to provide the student with the necessary skills to design or reverse-engineer to value and to hedge these products.

The basic thesis is that many social problems if looked at through an entrepreneurial lens create opportunity for someone to launch a venture that generates profits by alleviating that social problem. This sets in motion a virtuous cycle - the entrepreneur is incented to generate more profits and in so doing the more the profits made the more the problem is alleviated. Even if it is not possible to eventually create a profit-making enterprise the process of striving to do so can lead to a resource-lean not-for-profit entity. Creating a profitable social entrepreneurship venture is by no means a simple challenge.,[MGMT-810 -- MGMT-212],2.41,2.83,1.95,2.55,2.24,2.0,2.43,35

Or a government official who because of a tight reelection campaign or an internal challenge from a populist general turns on you? Lone individuals small activist groups and unexpected political shifts have done extensive damage to the reputations - and value - of multinationals in recent years.
